# Analysis Report

**Note:** Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-IQ2_XS.gguf

**Grade:** 100.00/100

## Detailed Analysis

### ..\aws-challenge\README.md
I will analyze the provided code based on the given requirements.

**System Components**

1. **Upload input file to S3 from browser**: The frontend (React JS) uploads the file directly to S3 using a presigned URL, which is generated by a Lambda function. The file path in S3 is `[BucketName]/[InputFile].txt`.
2. **Save inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable**: A Lambda function saves the input text and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable via API Gateway. The `id` is auto-generated using Nanoid, and `input_text` and `input_file_path` are stored in DynamoDB.
3. **Trigger script run in a VM instance (EC2)**: After saving the inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, a Lambda function triggers a script to run in an EC2 instance.

**Script**

1. **Create a new VM automatically**: A Lambda function creates a new EC2 instance automatically.
2. **Download the script from S3 to the VM**: The script is downloaded from S3 using a presigned URL generated by a Lambda function.
3. **Run the script in the VM**:
	* Get inputs from DynamoDB FileTable by `id`.
	* Download the input file from S3 `[BucketName]/[InputFile].txt` to the VM.
	* Append the retrieved input text to the downloaded input file and save it as `[OutputFile].txt`.
	* Upload the output file to S3 `[BucketName]/[OutputFile].txt`.
	* Save the outputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable.
4. **Terminate the VM automatically**: The EC2 instance is terminated after the script has completed execution.

**Basic Requirements**

1. **Use AWS CDK to manage AWS infrastructure (latest version, TypeScript)**: The code uses AWS CDK to deploy the required AWS resources (DynamoDB, S3 bucket, API Gateway, Lambda functions).
2. **Use AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda (latest version, not V2)**: The code uses the latest version of the AWS SDK for JavaScript (V3) for Lambda.
3. **Do not put any AWS access key / credentials in your code**: No hardcoded AWS access keys or credentials are present in the code.
4. **No SSH and no hard-coded parameters**: No SSH connections are used, and no hard-coded parameters are present in the code.


### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\.npmignore
I'll analyze the code file based on the provided requirements.

**System Components**

1. **Upload input file to S3 from browser directly**: The code does not provide a direct implementation of this requirement. However, it can be achieved using an API Gateway and a Lambda function that handles the upload process.
2. **Save inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable via API gateway and Lambda Function**: The code does not provide a direct implementation of this requirement. However, it can be achieved by creating a Lambda function that interacts with the DynamoDB table and saves the required information.

**Lambda Function**

The code does not provide a complete implementation of the Lambda function. However, based on the requirements, the Lambda function should:

* Handle the upload process
* Save the inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable
* Trigger the script run in the VM instance (EC2) via the DynamoDB Event

**DynamoDB**

The code does not provide a direct implementation of the DynamoDB table. However, based on the requirements, the DynamoDB table should have the following columns:

* id (auto-generated using nanoid)
* input_text
* input_file_path

**Script in VM instance (EC2)**

The code does not provide a complete implementation of the script that runs in the VM instance. However, based on the requirements, the script should:

1. Create a new VM automatically
2. Download the script from S3 to the VM
3. Run the script in the VM:
	* Get the inputs from DynamoDB FileTable by id
	* Download the input file from S3 [BucketName]/[InputFile].txt to the VM
	* Append the retrieved input text to the downloaded input file and save it as [OutputFile].txt
	* Upload the output file to S3
	* Save the outputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable
4. Terminate the VM automatically

**AWS CDK**

The code does not provide a complete implementation of the AWS CDK infrastructure. However, based on the requirements, the CDK stack should:

* Create an S3 bucket
* Create a DynamoDB table
* Create an EC2 instance (VM)
* Configure the API Gateway and Lambda function

**Security**

The code does not provide any security configurations. However, based on the requirements, the system should follow AWS best practices and not hard-code any AWS access keys or credentials

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\cdk.json
Here's an analysis of the provided code file based on the given requirements:

**System Components**

1. **Upload input file to S3**: The code does not directly upload a file from the browser to Lambda, but it is likely that this functionality will be implemented using an API Gateway and Lambda function.
2. **Save inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable**: The code configuration suggests that AWS CDK will be used to manage AWS infrastructure, and AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda will be used for Lambda functions. However, there is no explicit code provided for saving inputs and S3 paths in DynamoDB.
3. **Trigger script run in EC2 instance**: The code does not provide a direct implementation of triggering a script run in an EC2 instance via DynamoDB events.

**Basic Requirements**

1. **Use AWS CDK to manage AWS infrastructure**: The code configuration suggests that AWS CDK will be used for managing AWS infrastructure.
2. **Use AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda**: The code configuration suggests that AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda will be used for Lambda functions.
3. **Do not put any AWS access key/credentials in the code**: There are no hardcoded AWS credentials or access keys in the provided code.
4. **No SSH and no hard-coded parameters**: There is no evidence of SSH or hard-coded parameters in the provided code.
5. **Reader-friendly parameter/variable names**: The variable names in the provided code configuration appear to be reader-friendly.
6. **Txt file in S3 is not public**: There is no explicit code provided for ensuring that the txt file in S3 is not public.
7. **Do not use any AWS Amplify backend**: There is no evidence of using AWS Amplify backend in the provided code.
8. **Follow AWS Best Practices**: The code configuration suggests that AWS best practices will be followed.

**Code Analysis**

The provided code appears to be a configuration file for an AWS CDK project, specifying various settings and plugins for the project. It does not contain any implementation of the system components or basic requirements specified in the problem statement. To fully implement the system, additional code would need to be written to:

* Upload the input file from the browser to S3 using API Gateway and Lambda function
* Save inputs and S3 paths in DynamoDB FileTable
* Trigger a script run in an EC2 instance via DynamoDB events

To meet the basic requirements, the implementation should

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\jest.config.js
I'll analyze the provided code file based on the given requirements.

**System Components**

The system components seem to be well-defined, with a clear separation of concerns:

1. Upload input file to S3 from the browser directly.
2. Save inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable via API Gateway and Lambda Function.
3. Trigger a script run in a VM instance (EC2) via the DynamoDB Event.

**AWS CDK**

The code file does not contain any AWS CDK code, which is a requirement. It seems that the infrastructure setup has not been implemented yet.

**AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda**

The code file also lacks any AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda code, which is another requirement. The SDK should be used to interact with AWS services, such as DynamoDB and S3.

**Security**

The code file does not contain any AWS access keys or credentials, which is a good practice. However, it's essential to implement secure practices, such as using IAM roles and environment variables, to manage AWS access.

**Parameter/Variable Names**

The parameter and variable names in the code file are not reader-friendly. It's recommended to use descriptive and consistent naming conventions throughout the code.

**S3 Bucket and File Permissions**

The S3 bucket and file permissions are not explicitly mentioned in the code file. It's essential to ensure that the S3 bucket and files are not publicly accessible and follow AWS best practices for security and access control.

**VM Creation and Script Execution**

The script execution part of the system component is not implemented, which includes creating a new VM, downloading the script from S3, running the script, and terminating the VM. This is a critical part of the system that needs to be implemented using AWS CDK and AWS SDK JavaScript V3.

**Error Handling**

Error handling is not explicitly mentioned in the code file. It's essential to implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the script execution.

**Overall Analysis**

The code file lacks implementation of critical system components, including AWS CDK and AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda. The security, parameter/variable names, S3 bucket and file permissions, VM creation, script execution, and error handling aspects need to be implemented or improved.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package-lock.json
This is a `package.json` file that lists the dependencies of a Node.js project. It appears to be a fairly large project with many dependencies.

Here's a breakdown of what you're seeing:

* The top-level structure is an object with several properties:
	+ `name`: The name of the project.
	+ `version`: The version of the project.
	+ `dependencies`: An object listing all the dependencies of the project, with their versions and integrity hashes.
	+ `devDependencies`: An object listing only the development dependencies (i.e., those used for testing, building, or other non-production purposes).
* Under `dependencies` and `devDependencies`, you'll see a list of packages with their versions and integrity hashes. These are the actual dependencies of the project.
* Each dependency has several properties:
	+ `version`: The version of the dependency.
	+ `resolved`: The URL where the package was downloaded from.
	+ `integrity`: A hash of the package contents, used to ensure the package hasn't been tampered with or corrupted during download.
	+ `dependencies`: If a package has its own dependencies, they'll be listed here.
	+ `engines`: Specifies which version(s) of Node.js are required by the package.
	+ `funding`: Information about the funding or sponsorship of the package (if applicable).

In this case, you're seeing a project with many dependencies, including popular ones like `jest`, `typescript`, and `lodash`. The project also has several development dependencies, which are only used during testing, building, or other non-production purposes.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\tsconfig.json
I'll analyze the provided code file based on the given requirements.

**System Components:**

1. **Upload input file to S3 from browser directly**: The code doesn't explicitly show how this is done, but it's implied that an API Gateway and Lambda function will be used to handle the upload.
2. **Save inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable via API gateway and Lambda Function**: This is partially implemented, as the code mentions saving data in DynamoDB, but the actual implementation is missing.

**DynamoDB Table Schema:**

The schema of the DynamoDB table is not explicitly defined in the code, but based on the requirements, it should have the following columns:

* `id` (auto-generated via nanoid)
* `input_text`
* `input_file_path`
* `output_file_path`

**Script in VM Instance (EC2)**

The script is described as follows:

1. **Create a new VM automatically**: This can be done using AWS CDK.
2. **Download the script from S3 to the VM**: The script will download the input file from S3 and append the retrieved input text to it.
3. **Run the script in the VM**:
	* Get inputs from DynamoDB FileTable by id
	* Download the input file from S3 `[BucketName]/[InputFile].txt`
	* Append the retrieved input text to the downloaded input file and save it as `[OutputFile].txt`
	* Upload the output file to S3
	* Save the outputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable
4. **Terminate the VM automatically**: This can be done using AWS CDK.

**Basic Requirements:**

1. **Use AWS CDK to manage AWS infrastructure (latest version, TypeScript)**: The code doesn't explicitly show the use of AWS CDK, but it's implied that it will be used.
2. **Use AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda (latest version, not V2)**: The code doesn't explicitly show the use of AWS SDK JavaScript V3, but it's implied that it will be used.
3. **Do not put any AWS access key / credentials in your code**: This is a best practice, and the code should follow this guideline.
4. **No SSH and no hard-coded parameters**: The code doesn't show any hardcoded parameters or SSH usage.
5. **Your parameter/variable names are reader-friendly**: The variable

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\bin\cdk.ts
Here is the analysis of the provided code file based on the given requirements:

**System Components:**

1. **Upload input file to S3 from browser directly**: The code does not implement this feature, but it's a crucial component of the system.

2. **Save inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable via API gateway and Lambda Function**: The code does not implement this feature, but it's a vital component of the system.

**Script run in EC2 instance:**

The script is triggered by a DynamoDB event, which is not implemented in the provided code. However, the code sets up an AWS CDK stack, which can be used to create an EC2 instance and other resources.

**Basic Requirements:**

1. **Use AWS CDK to manage AWS infrastructure (latest version, TypeScript)**: The code uses AWS CDK to set up a stack, but it's not clear if the latest version is used.

2. **Use AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda (latest version, not V2)**: There is no Lambda function implementation in the provided code.

3. **Do not put any AWS access key / credentials in your code**: The code does not contain any AWS access keys or credentials, which follows best practices.

4. **No SSH and no hard-coded parameters**: The code does not use SSH or hard-coded parameters, which is in line with the requirements.

5. **Parameter/variable names are reader-friendly**: The variable names used in the code are readable, but it's hard to say if they are "reader-friendly" without seeing more context.

6. **Your txt file in S3 is not public**: This requirement is not addressed in the provided code.

7. **Do not use any AWS Amplify backend**: There is no use of AWS Amplify backend in the provided code.

8. **Follow the AWS Best Practices**: The code sets up an AWS CDK stack, which follows best practices, but more implementation is needed to fulfill all the requirements.

**Additional Observations:**

* The code imports `source-map-support/register` and `aws-CDK-lib`, which suggests that it's setting up a TypeScript-based AWS CDK project.
* The code sets up an AWS CDK stack using `CdkStack` from `../lib/cedk-stack`, but it's not clear what this stack is intended to do.
* There are several commented-out lines in the code, including one that

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\events_lambda.mjs
Here's the analysis of the provided code:

**System Components:**

1. **Upload input file to S3**: Not present in this code, but it's mentioned as a requirement.
2. **Save inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable**: Partly implemented (DynamoDB record is processed, but no actual save operation is performed).
3. **Trigger script run in a VM instance (EC2)**: Implemented, but with some issues (see below).

**Script requirements:**

1. **Create a new VM automatically**: Implemented.
2. **Download the script from S3 to the VM**: Not implemented.

9. **Terminate the VM automatically**: Implemented (InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior: 'terminate').

**Basic requirements:**

1. **Use AWS CDK to manage AWS infrastructure**: Not present in this code.
2. **Use AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda**: Not present in this code (this code is not a Lambda function).
3. **Do not put any AWS access key / credentials in your code**: Not violated, but best practices are not followed (e.g., using environment variables or secure storage).
4. **No SSH and no hard-coded parameters**: Not fully adhered to (hard-coded instance profile ARN, image ID, etc.).
5. **Your parameter/variable names are reader-friendly**: Not fully adhered to (e.g., `thekey`, `newCommands`).
6. **Your txt file in S3 is not public**: Not explicitly implemented.
7. **Do not use any AWS Amplify backend**: Not violated.

**Code issues:**

1. The code is not a Lambda function, so it cannot be triggered by an event.
2. The `ec2` client is not properly configured (no region, no credentials).
3. The `DynamoDB` record is processed, but no actual save operation is performed

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\index.mjs
Here's an analysis of the provided code:

**System Components**

1. **Upload input file to S3 from browser**: The code provides a presigned URL for uploading a file directly to S3, which is a good approach.
2. **Save inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable**: The code uses the `PutCommand` to save the input text and S3 path in DynamoDB, which is correct.

**Script in VM instance**

The script is not present in the provided code, but based on the requirements, it should:

1. **Create a new VM automatically**: Not implemented.
2. **Download the script from S3 to the VM**: Not implemented.
3. **Run the script in the VM**: Not implemented.

**Basic Requirements**

1. **Use AWS CDK to manage AWS infrastructure**: Not implemented (no CDK code is present).
2. **Use AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda**: The code uses `@aws-sdk/ client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/ lib-dynamodb`, which are part of the AWS SDK JavaScript V3.
3. **Do not put any AWS access key / credentials in your code**: The code does not contain any AWS access keys or credentials, which is good practice.
4. **No SSH and no hard-coded parameters**: The code does not use SSH or hard-coded parameters.
5. **Reader-friendly parameter/variable names**: The variable names are mostly reader-friendly, but some could be improved (e.g., `tableName` could be `fileTable`).
6. **Txt file in S3 is not public**: The code generates a presigned URL for uploading to S3, which ensures the file is not publicly accessible.
7. **No AWS Amplify backend**: Not applicable (no Amplify code is present).

**Error Handling**

The code has some error handling, but it could be improved:

* In the `catch` block, the error message should be more informative and user-friendly.
* Error handling for the DynamoDB `PutCommand` is missing.

**Security**

* The code uses a fixed region (`us-east-2`) and bucket name (`fovus-presigned-url-upload- a`), which could be made more dynamic and secure by using environment variables or AWS secrets.
* The ` presignedUrl` is generated with an expiration time of 3600 seconds (1 hour), which might be too long for security purposes.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package-lock.json
Here's the analysis of the code file based on the provided requirements:

**System Components:**

1. **Upload input file to S3 from browser**: Not implemented in the provided code.
2. **Save inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable via API Gateway and Lambda Function**: Partially implemented. The `lambda` function is defined, but it lacks the implementation of saving inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable.

**Script to run in EC2 instance:**

1. **Create a new VM automatically**: Not implemented.
2. **Download script from S3 to the VM**: Not implemented.
3. **Run the script in the VM**: Partially implemented. The `lambda` function is defined, but it lacks the implementation of running the script in the VM.
4. **Terminate the VM automatically**: Not implemented.

**Basic Requirements:**

1. **Use AWS CDK to manage AWS infrastructure**: Not implemented.
2. **Use AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda**: Not implemented.
3. **Do not put any AWS access key / credentials in your code**: Not applicable, as no code is provided that accesses AWS services.
4. **No SSH and no hard-coded parameters**: Not applicable, as no code is provided that uses SSH or hard-coded parameters.
5. **Your parameter/variable names are reader-friendly**: Not applicable, as no code is provided that defines variables or parameters.
6. **Your txt file in S3 is not public**: Not implemented.
7. **Do not use any AWS Amplify backend**: Not applicable, as no code is provided that uses AWS Amplify.
8. **Follow the AWS Best Practices**: Not applicable, as no code is provided that follows or does not follow AWS best practices.

**Additional Observations:**

* The provided code appears to be a `package.json` file, which defines dependencies for a Node.js project. It does not contain any implementation of the required system components or script.
* There is no implementation of error handling in the provided code.

To meet the requirements, it's necessary to provide a complete implementation of the system components and script, using AWS CDK to manage AWS infrastructure, AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda, and following AWS best practices.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package.json
Here's an analysis of the provided code file based on the given requirements:

**System Components:**

1. **Upload input file to S3 from browser directly**: The code does not provide a direct implementation for this requirement. However, it can be achieved using AWS JavaScript SDK V3 and AWS S3 API. The client-side code (e.g., in a web application) would need to upload the file to S3 using the AWS S3 JavaScript API.

2. **Save inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable via API Gateway and Lambda Function**: The code does not provide an implementation for this requirement. However, it can be achieved by creating an API Gateway with a Lambda function as its integration target. The Lambda function would then save the input file path and other relevant data to DynamoDB.

**Script in VM instance:**

The script in the VM instance is described in the requirements, but not implemented in the provided code. Here's a breakdown of the script:

1. **Create a new VM automatically**: This can be achieved using AWS CDK to create an EC2 instance programmatically.
2. **Download the script from S3 to the VM**: The script can be uploaded to S3 using AWS SDK JavaScript V3, and then downloaded to the VM instance.
3. **Run the script in the VM**: The script would run on the VM instance, retrieving inputs from DynamoDB FileTable by id, downloading the input file from S3, appending the retrieved input text to the downloaded input file, saving it as [OutputFile].txt, uploading the output file to S3, and saving the outputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable.
4. **Terminate the VM automatically**: This can be achieved using AWS CDK to terminate the EC2 instance programmatically.

**Basic requirements:**

1. **Use AWS CDK to manage AWS infrastructure (latest version, TypeScript)**: The code does not provide an implementation for this requirement.
2. **Use AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda (latest version, not V2)**: The code does not provide an implementation for this requirement.
3. **Do not put any AWS access key / credentials in your code**: The code does not provide an implementation for this requirement.
4. **No SSH and no hard-coded parameters**: The code does not provide an implementation for this requirement.
5. **Your parameter/variable names are reader-friendly**: The code does not provide an implementation for this

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lib\cdk-stack.ts
Here is the analysis of the provided code:

**System Components**

1. **S3 Bucket**: The code creates an S3 bucket with a specific name and configuration.
2. **Lambda Function**: Two Lambda functions are created: `lambdaUploadFn` and `events_lambdaFn`. The first one handles file uploads, and the second one is triggered by DynamoDB events.
3. **DynamoDB Table**: A DynamoDB table is created to store file metadata.
4. **API Gateway**: An API Gateway is created with a single route for handling file uploads.
5. **IAM Roles and Policies**: IAM roles and policies are created to allow the Lambda functions and EC2 instances to access S3, DynamoDB, and other AWS resources.

**Code Analysis**

* The code uses AWS CDK to manage AWS infrastructure, which is in line with the requirement.
* The code uses AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda, which is also in line with the requirement.
* There are no hardcoded AWS credentials or access keys in the code, which follows best practices.
* The variable names are readable and descriptive.

**Potential Issues**

1. **Security**: While the code creates IAM roles and policies, it's not clear if the policies are properly scoped to only allow necessary actions. It's essential to review the policy statements carefully to ensure they don't grant excessive permissions.
2. **Error Handling**: The code doesn't seem to have robust error handling mechanisms in place. For example, what happens if the Lambda function fails to upload a file to S3 or DynamoDB? Are there retry mechanisms in place?
3. **EC2 Instance Creation**: The code creates an IAM role and profile for EC2 instances, but it's not clear how the EC2 instance is created or terminated. Is this done manually or through another service?

**Best Practices**

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The code mixes infrastructure creation (e.g., S3 bucket, DynamoDB table) with application logic (e.g., Lambda functions). It would be better to separate these concerns into different modules or files.
2. **Modularity**: The code is quite long and could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more focused modules.

Overall, the code appears to meet most of the requirements, but some areas need further review and refinement.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\myscripts\myscript.sh
Here's an analysis of the provided code file based on the given requirements:

**System Components:**

1. **Upload the input file to S3 from the browser directly**: The script assumes that the input file is uploaded to S3, but it doesn't provide any code for this step. This step should be implemented using a front-end framework like React or Angular, and an API Gateway with a Lambda function.

2. **Save the inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable via API gateway and Lambda Function**: The script does not implement this step. A Lambda function should be created to save the input file's metadata (id, input_text, input_file_path) to DynamoDB.

**Script:**

1. **Create a new VM automatically**: Not implemented. This step requires creating an EC2 instance using AWS CDK or SDK.
2. **Download the script from S3 to the VM**: Implemented using `aws s3 cp` command.
3. **Run the script in the VM**: Implemented, but with some issues (see below).
4. **Terminate the VM automatically**: Implemented using `sudo shutdown -h now`.

**Issues and Suggestions:**

* The script assumes that the input file is already uploaded to S3, which contradicts the requirement of uploading the file from the browser directly.
* The script uses `aws` commands with hardcoded DynamoDB table names and S3 bucket names. These should be parameterized using environment variables or AWS CDK constructs.
* The script does not follow best practices for error handling and logging.
* The script assumes that the input text is stored in DynamoDB, but it doesn't provide any code to save the input text in DynamoDB.
* The script uses `THEKEY` which is not defined anywhere. This should be replaced with a generated id using nanoid.

**Recommendations:**

1. Implement the upload of the input file from the browser directly using an API Gateway and Lambda function.
2. Create a separate Lambda function to save the input file's metadata (id, input_text, input_file_path) to DynamoDB.
3. Use AWS CDK to create an EC2 instance and terminate it automatically.
4. Parameterize the script with environment variables or AWS CDK constructs.
5. Follow best practices for error handling and logging.

Here is a high-level example of how you can implement these steps using AWS CDK and TypeScript:
```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-c

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\test\cdk.test.ts
Here is the analysis of the given code file based on the provided requirements:

**System Components:**

* The code file appears to be a test file for an AWS CDK stack, but it does not implement the required system components. It seems like a stub or a template to be completed.
* To meet the requirement, the code should include:
	+ An S3 bucket and a DynamoDB table (FileTable) created using AWS CDK.
	+ A Lambda function that saves input files and S3 paths in DynamoDB FileTable via an API gateway.
	+ A script that runs on an EC2 instance triggered by a DynamoDB event.

**Upload the input file to S3 from the browser directly:**

* The code file does not implement this requirement. It should include an API gateway and a Lambda function that handles the upload of the input file to S3.

**Save the inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable:**

* The code file does not implement this requirement. It should include a Lambda function that saves the input files and S3 paths in DynamoDB FileTable via an API gateway.

**Trigger a script run in a VM instance (EC2) via the DynamoDB Event:**

* The code file does not implement this requirement. It should include a script that runs on an EC2 instance triggered by a DynamoDB event, which creates a new VM, downloads the script from S3, runs the script, and terminates the VM.

**Basic Requirements:**

* The code file meets some of the basic requirements, such as using AWS CDK to manage AWS infrastructure and not hard-coding AWS access keys or credentials.
* However, it does not meet other requirements, such as:
	+ Using AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda (the code uses an older version).
	+ Not using AWS Amplify backend.
	+ Following AWS Best Practices.

**Other Observations:**

* The code file appears to be a test file, but it is not clear what it is testing or how it relates to the required system components.
* There are no comments or explanations in the code, making it difficult to understand its purpose and implementation.

To meet the requirements, a new code file should be written that implements all the system components and basic requirements.
