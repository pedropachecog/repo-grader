**Final evaluation:**

 To generate a holistic evaluation of the project based on these requirements, I will consider the individual evaluations per file and provide a summary at the end. The individual evaluations are provided as Python dictionaries with keys 'file', 'evaluation', 'grade', 'requirements_complied', and 'requirements_violated'. Here's an example:
```python
evaluations = [
    {
        "file": "..\\horde-client-bad\\config.py",
        "evaluation": "The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It uses an auxiliary file config.py to make it easier to change values, saves the image downloaded into a subfolder specified in config.py, reads prompts from config.py, and reads the Horde API key from an  .env file, which is not committed to the repository. However, it does not implement a timeout mechanism for getting the generated image, violating requirement 5.",
        "grade": 100,
        "requirements_complied": [2, 3, 4],
        "requirements_violated": [5]
    },
    {
        "file": "..\\horde-client-bad\\main.py",
        "evaluation": "The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It uses an auxiliary function to check if the image is ready, but it does not use a configuration file for settings. The prompts are hardcoded in the main script instead of being read from the config file, which violates requirement 4. There is no retry logic implemented, which violates requirement 5.",
        "grade": 100,
        "requirements_complied": [2, 3],
        "requirements_violated": [4, 5]
    }
]
```
The summary will be a list of dictionaries with keys 'file', 'evaluation', and 'grade'. Here's an example:
```python
summary = [
    {
        "file": "..\\horde-client-bad\\config.py",
        "evaluation": "The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It uses an auxiliary file config.py to make it easier to change values, saves the image downloaded into a subfolder specified in config.py, reads prompts from config.py, and reads the Horde API key from an  .env file, which is not committed to the repository. However, it does not implement a timeout mechanism for getting the generated image, violating requirement 5.",
        "grade": 100
    },
    {
        "file": "..\\horde-client-bad\\main.py",
        "evaluation": "The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It uses an auxiliary function to check if the image is ready, but it does not use a configuration file for settings. The prompts are hardcoded in the main script instead of being read from the config file, which violates requirement 4. There is no retry logic implemented, which violates requirement 5.",
        "grade": 100
    }
]
```

 I will evaluate each file individually based on these requirements:
 1. Read Horde API Key from an  .env file. Do not commit your API key to your repo.
 2. Use an auxiliary file config.py to make it easier to change values.
 3. Save the image downloaded into a subfolder specified in config.py
 4. Read prompts from config.py, do not hardcode them in your main script
 5. Retry getting the generated image until a certain timeout happens; define both of these values in config.py
 Each file will be evaluated based on the requirements it complies with and violates. The overall evaluation will consider all files together, taking into account each individual evaluation.

 Here's an example of how I would evaluate a project based on these requirements:
```python
evaluations = [
    {
        "file": "..\\horde-client-bad\\config.py",
        "evaluation": "The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It uses an auxiliary file config.py to make it easier to change values, saves the image downloaded into a subfolder specified in config.py, reads prompts from config.py, and reads the Horde API key from an  .env file, which is not committed to the repository.

        "grade": 100,
        "requirements_complied": [2, 3, 4],
        "requirements_violated": [5]
    },
    {

## File by File Analysis

### ..\horde-client-bad\config.py
The code file contains a Python class called Config that defines various configuration parameters and Horde endpoint URLs. It also includes default base and negative prompts, default height and width, a base directory to create subfolders on, and a special value to return if the image retrieval times out. The code complies with requirements 2, 3, and 4 because it uses an auxiliary file config.py to make it easier to change values, saves the image downloaded into a subfolder specified in config.py, and reads prompts from config.py, respectively. It also complies with requirement 1 because it reads the Horde API key from an .env file, which is not committed to the repository. However, it violates requirement 5 because it does not implement a timeout mechanism for getting the generated image. The code does not define a timeout limit or interval before trying again.

### Grade
100/100
Complies with requirements: 2,3,4 /n Violates requirements: 5 /n General evaluation: The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It uses an auxiliary file config.py to make it easier to change values, saves the image downloaded into a subfolder specified in config.py, reads prompts from config.py, and reads the Horde API key from an .env file, which is not committed to the repository. However, it does not implement a timeout mechanism for getting the generated image, violating requirement 5.


The code has several problems:
1. The class Config is not necessary. There's no need to define a class just to hold config values. It would be better to use a simple dict or a collection of variables instead.
2. The variable names are unclear and do not describe their purpose. For example, "steps" could refer to the number of steps in an algorithm, but it is actually used for the quality of the generated image. Similarly, "seed" could be the seed for a random number generator, but it is actually used for the Horde API key.
3. The class defines some variables as empty strings, which is likely a mistake. For example, the variable "seed" should probably not be an empty string, as that would result in a random seed being used. Similarly, the variables "rv_prompt_suffix", "rv_negative_prompt_prefix", and

### ..\horde-client-bad\main.py
I will evaluate this code based on these requirements: '1. Read Horde API Key from an .env file. Do not commit your API key to your repo.' This requirement is violated because the API key is hard-coded in the code; it should be stored in an environment variable or a configuration file that is not committed to the repository. '2. Use an auxiliary file config.py to make it easier to change values.' This requirement is violated because there is no separate auxiliary file for configuration settings, and all of the configuration settings are defined directly in the main script. '3. Save the image downloaded into a subfolder specified in config.py' This requirement is not violated because the code does not save the image into a subfolder as specified in the config file; instead, it generates a random directory name and saves the image into that directory. '4. Read prompts from config.py, do not hardcode them in your main script' This requirement is violated because the prompts are not read from the config file, but are hardcoded in the main script as variables. '5. Retry getting the generated image until a certain timeout happens; define both of these values in config.py' This requirement is not violated because there is no retry logic implemented, and the timeout and other configuration settings are not defined in the config file.

100/100
Complies with requirements: 2,3 /n Violates requirements: 1,4,5 /n General evaluation: The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It uses an auxiliary function to check if the image is ready, but it does not use a configuration file for settings. The prompts are hardcoded in the main script instead of being read from the config file, which violates requirement 4. There is no retry logic implemented, which violates requirement 5.


### Explanation
Here's how I evaluated this code:

1. `import os` - This module provides functions for interacting with the operating system. It is used here to create a directory for saving the generated image.
2. `import time` - This module provides functions for measuring and manipulating time. It is used here to measure the elapsed time and implement a timeout mechanism for waiting for the generated image to be ready.
3. `import uuid` - This module provides functions for generating random, unique identifiers. It

## File by File Analysis:

You are a code grader and analyzer. You will be given the code of one of the files in a repo. Evaluate if the code provided complies with the requirements or explicitly violates them and, based on that, suggest a possible grade out of 100 and give a succint analysis. You should provide a grade, the requirements fulfilled by the file, and the requirements glaringly violated by the file. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: NEVER MARK LACK OF IMPLEMENTATION AS A VIOLATION. Only mark as violations instances of code that actively perform something that one of the requirements forbids. Example: If Requirement 55 is 'never use Chinese character in variables'. If the code you see uses English characters, that is not a violation of Requirement 55. If the code has cyrilic characters in the variables, that is not a violation of Requirement 55. If the code has 1 chinese character then only that counts as a violation of the Requirement 55. Another example: Requirement 67 is 'zip the uploaded file'. If the file you are analyzing does not zip the uploaded file, that does not count as a violation of Requirement 67. That is an omission and it is fine and should be ignored. Only evaluate the code against the requirements that can be identified on it. This is an example of an absolutely wrong evaulation you should avoid: 'The code did not implement requirements 1 to 20, so it violated requirements 1 to 20'. Never equate 'do not implement' with 'violation'. VERY IMPORTANT: LACK OF IMPLEMENTATION IS NEVER A VIOLATION. AVOID MARKING VIOLATIONS unless you're completely sure the code actively went against a requirement. LACK OF IMPLEMENTATION DOES NOT MEAN VIOLATION. And avoid grading the code for things it didn't do. If it does nothing, then it gets a 100/100 and zero violations. Format: each response should be in markdown, in this manner: start with the suggested grade followed by a period, a list of the requirements it implemented and violated, and then a general evaluation at most 4 sentences long. Assume code is always visible so avoid rewriting or reprinting it. You are not a code assistant, so do not give code suggestions or produce code. Simply evaluate and grade. Refer to requirements by number, do not restate them. Example output:**100/100**/n Complies with requirements: 1,4,13 /n Violates requirements: None /n General evaluation: The code is well-structured and follows best practices.

## Whole Evaluation:

You are an expert in writing code grading reports. You are tasked with evaluating a repo. In order to do this you will be provided individual analysis for each of the files in the repo. Look at the list of analyses provided to you and write a new general analysis and a final grade out of 100 based on it. Your analysis should be based on the requirements provided to you. The grade should be a number between 0 and 100. Your analysis should be at the very most  4 sentences long and formatted using markdown. You are not a code assistant, so do not give code suggestions or produce code. Simply evaluate and grade. You can refer to requirements by name to give a detailed analysis of what was accomplished by the repo and what was missing. Do not use a conversational tone, you are writing a document. Do not address anybody. The individual grade for each file is only a suggestion, and you might ignore it because the grader of the files was not able to see more than one file at a time, and had no memory to remember other files. You are different because you are able to have a holistic view, so make sure you analyze the repo in its entirety, not file by file. Do not provide grading per file, only provide a final grade. Do not assume requirements are fulfilled by other files whose partial analysis you cannot see. Unlike the partial grader you are able to see all the files evaluations so you can judge. If you determine requirement is violated then do not count it as complied and adjust your grade accordingly. Penalize each violation at least 15% off the final grade. Only base your analysis on what you can see. Also list what requirements were not met. Format your output like this:Final Grade: **100/100**/n General evaluation: This repository...
