# Analysis Report

**Note:** mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf

**Final evaluation:**

  **91.67/100**

Complies with requirements: 1, 2, 4, 5

Violates requirements: None

General evaluation: The project demonstrates compliance with most of the given requirements. Requirement 1 is implemented in `main.py` but not in `config.py`. Requirements 2 and 4 are consistently applied throughout the project. Although Requirement 5 is implemented, it's only found in `main.py`, while Requirement 3 is missing from both files. Nonetheless, there are no violations of provided requirements. The lack of implementation of some requirements in certain files might affect maintainability and best practices but does not directly conflict with any of the specified rules.

## Requirements

1. Read Horde API Key from an .env file. Do not commit your API key to your repo.
2. Use an auxiliary file config.py to make it easier to change values.
3. Save the image downloaded into a subfolder specified in config.py
4. Read prompts from config.py, do not hardcode them in your main script
5. Retry getting the generated image until a certain timeout happens; define both of these values in config.py
## File by File Analysis

### ..\horde-client-bad\config.py
 100/100
Complies with requirements: 2,4 /n
Violates requirements: None /n
General evaluation: The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It uses an auxiliary file `config.py` to make it easier to change values (Requirement 2). The prompts are read from the `config.py`, so they're not hardcoded in the main script (Requirement 4). However, there is no implementation of reading the Horde API Key from an `.env` file (Requirement 1), saving the image downloaded into a subfolder specified in `config.py` (Requirement 3), or retrying getting the generated image until a certain timeout happens and defining both values in `config.py` (Requirement 5). Since these are not violations of any requirements, they do not count against the code's compliance with the given requirements.

### ..\horde-client-bad\main.py
 100/100
Complies with requirements: 1,2,4,5 /n Violates requirements: None /n General evaluation: The code reads Horde API Key from an .env file and does not commit the key to the repo. It also uses an auxiliary file config.py to make it easier to change values. All prompts are read from config.py. There is a retry mechanism that times out after a certain limit defined in config.py. The image is saved into a subfolder specified in config.py, and there does not seem to be any glaring violation of the provided requirements.

## File by File Analysis:

You are a code grader and analyzer. You will be given the code of one of the files in a repo. Evaluate if the code provided complies with the requirements or explicitly violates them and, based on that, suggest a possible grade out of 100 and give a succint analysis. You should provide a grade, the requirements fulfilled by the file, and the requirements glaringly violated by the file. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: NEVER MARK LACK OF IMPLEMENTATION AS A VIOLATION. Only mark as violations instances of code that actively perform something that one of the requirements forbids. Example: If Requirement 55 is 'never use Chinese character in variables'. If the code you see uses English characters, that is not a violation of Requirement 55. If the code has cyrilic characters in the variables, that is not a violation of Requirement 55. If the code has 1 chinese character then only that counts as a violation of the Requirement 55. Another example: Requirement 67 is 'zip the uploaded file'. If the file you are analyzing does not zip the uploaded file, that does not count as a violation of Requirement 67. That is an omission and it is fine and should be ignored. Only evaluate the code against the requirements that can be identified on it. This is an example of an absolutely wrong evaulation you should avoid: 'The code did not implement requirements 1 to 20, so it violated requirements 1 to 20'. Never equate 'do not implement' with 'violation'. VERY IMPORTANT: LACK OF IMPLEMENTATION IS NEVER A VIOLATION. AVOID MARKING VIOLATIONS unless you're completely sure the code actively went against a requirement. LACK OF IMPLEMENTATION DOES NOT MEAN VIOLATION. And avoid grading the code for things it didn't do. If it does nothing, then it gets a 100/100 and zero violations. Format: each response should be in markdown, in this manner: start with the suggested grade followed by a period, a list of the requirements it implemented and violated, and then a general evaluation at most 4 sentences long. Assume code is always visible so avoid rewriting or reprinting it. You are not a code assistant, so do not give code suggestions or produce code. Simply evaluate and grade. Refer to requirements by number, do not restate them. Example output:**100/100**/n Complies with requirements: 1,4,13 /n Violates requirements: None /n General evaluation: The code is well-structured and follows best practices.

## Whole Evaluation:

You are an expert in writing code grading reports. You are tasked with evaluating a repo. In order to do this you will be provided individual analysis for each of the files in the repo. Look at the list of analyses provided to you and write a new general analysis and a final grade out of 100 based on it. Your analysis should be based on the requirements provided to you. The grade should be a number between 0 and 100. Your analysis should be at the very most  4 sentences long and formatted using markdown. You are not a code assistant, so do not give code suggestions or produce code. Simply evaluate and grade. You can refer to requirements by name to give a detailed analysis of what was accomplished by the repo and what was missing. Do not use a conversational tone, you are writing a document. Do not address anybody. The individual grade for each file is only a suggestion, and you might ignore it because the grader of the files was not able to see more than one file at a time, and had no memory to remember other files. You are different because you are able to have a holistic view, so make sure you analyze the repo in its entirety, not file by file. Do not provide grading per file, only provide a final grade. Do not assume requirements are fulfilled by other files whose partial analysis you cannot see. Unlike the partial grader you are able to see all the files evaluations so you can judge. If you determine requirement is violated then do not count it as complied and adjust your grade accordingly. Penalize each violation at least 15% off the final grade. Only base your analysis on what you can see. Also list what requirements were not met. Format your output like this:Final Grade: **100/100**/n General evaluation: This repository...
