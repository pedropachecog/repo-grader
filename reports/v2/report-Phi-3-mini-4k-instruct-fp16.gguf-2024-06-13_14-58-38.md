# Analysis Report

**Note:** Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-fp16.gguf

**Final evaluation:**

  **70/100** The code provided utilizes AWS CDK for managing infrastructure, but it does not meet all requirements. It lacks the implementation of creating a new VM automatically, triggering the script execution on the EC2 instance after the file is uploaded in S3 and saved to DynamoDB FileTable, handling errors during the script execution, and saving outputs in DynamoDB as required. The code also includes some best practices violations such as hard-coded parameters and no error handling for certain AWS SDK calls.

## File by File Analysis

### ..\aws-challenge\README.md
 **90/100** The code provided does meet most requirements. However, the lack of real-time status updates in the application's UI for monitoring the process could be improved. Additionally, there seems to be no implementation for terminating the EC2 instances after the script has run.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\.npmignore
 **90/100** The code provided manages AWS infrastructure using CDK, employs AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda, and follows the given variable naming conventions. However, it lacks some key requirements such as: no SSH or hard-coded parameters, non-public text file in S3, and error handling in the script run on the EC2 instance. Additionally, it does not follow AWS Best Practices by not specifying any IAM policies for the Lambda function, no CloudWatch logs setup, and no use of DynamoDB Streams for triggering the EC2 instance. Lastly, there's no mention of handling errors during the file upload and saving process in DynamoDB FileTable.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\cdk.json
 **80/100** The provided code sets up AWS infrastructure using CDK and makes use of TypeScript. It also utilizes the AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda. However, the requirements specify that the system should upload the input file directly from the browser, but the current setup does not seem to handle this aspect. Additionally, the script for creating and managing the VM instances, downloading the scripts and input files, running the script, and handling outputs is not included in the code provided. Moreover, the code contains many best practices flags, but it's unclear if all of them are being followed. Lastly, the S3 bucket policy should be set to private and no AWS access keys or credentials should be present in the code or environment variables as stated in the requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\jest.config.js
 **80/100** The code does not fully comply with the requirements as it only defines Jest test settings and doesn't include the implementation for uploading files to S3, saving inputs in DynamoDB, triggering a script run in EC2, and managing AWS resources using CDK. It is also missing error handling for potential issues during the script execution on the EC2 instance. Additionally, it lacks the implementation of retrieving, appending, and uploading output files, and terminating the VM automatically.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package-lock.json
 The output shows the package dependencies and their versions for a given project, as well as any sub-dependencies (i.e., dependencies of the dependencies). The root package in this case is "myproject", which has several direct dependencies like "@angular/cli", "@types/jest", "@typescript-eslint/parser", and so on. Each of these packages can have their own sub-dependencies, such as "typescript" being a dependency of "@angular/cli". The output also shows the package version, location where it was installed (node\_modules), its integrity (a hashed value for verifying downloads), whether it is a development dependency or not, and the required Node.js version to run the package. There's also information about funding sources for some packages if applicable.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package.json
 **90/100** The code uses AWS CDK for infrastructure management and AWS SDK v3 in the Lambda function. It also follows the basic requirements, such as no hard-coded parameters, reader-friendly variable names, non-public S3 text files, and not using AWS Amplify backend. However, it lacks some features:
    - The system does not create a new VM automatically for each input file.
    - There is no DynamoDB Event trigger to start the EC2 instance script run after the file is uploaded in S3 and added to DynamoDB.
    - Error handling seems to be missing, as there's no explicit code to handle potential errors during the execution of the Lambda function or the EC2 scripts.
    - The code does not follow AWS best practices by not specifying an IAM role for the Lambda function with the necessary permissions and not using a custom VPC for the resources.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\tsconfig.json
 **70/100** The code provided uploads the input file to S3, saves the inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, and triggers a script run in an EC2 instance. However, it does not follow some AWS Best Practices as there are hard-coded parameters, no error handling in the script execution, and the script is sent directly to the EC2 instance (not downloaded from S3). The code also lacks comments and readability improvements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\bin\cdk.ts
 **75/100**
The code provided creates an AWS CDK stack using TypeScript and uses the latest version of AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda. However, it fails to comply with some requirements:
- The script does not upload the input file directly from the browser (requirement 1)
- The system does not create a new VM automatically or trigger the script run in an EC2 instance upon file upload (requirement 4)
- The system does not save inputs, S3 path, outputs, and S3 output path in DynamoDB FileTable (requirements 2 and 5)
- The code does not follow AWS Best Practices by putting access key / credentials in the code.

The script only sets up the infrastructure for uploading files to S3 and interacting with DynamoDB, but it doesn't handle the actual execution of the provided script on an EC2 instance after file upload. Additionally, it does not save any data in DynamoDB FileTable as required.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\events_lambda.mjs
 **80/100** The code provided uploads the input file to S3 and saves the inputs in DynamoDB, but it fails to download the script from S3, run it on an EC2 instance, generate output and save it in DynamoDB. Additionally, the code uses hard-coded parameters, does not follow best practices for AWS access keys/credentials, and the file uploaded to S3 is public (not private).

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\index.mjs
 **80/100** The code provided uploads the input file to S3 and saves the input in DynamoDB as required. However, it lacks the implementation of steps 2-4 from the script, which include creating a new VM, running the script on the VM, and saving the output in DynamoDB. Additionally, there is no error handling when triggering the script or handling any possible failures during the script execution. Furthermore, the code does not implement a proper EC2 instance creation or termination mechanism. The code also does not follow the requirement to use AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda (latest version).

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package-lock.json
 **60/100** The code provided uploads the input file to S3 and saves it in DynamoDB. However, there is no evidence of creating a new EC2 instance automatically or triggering a script run on that instance for further processing. Error handling is missing in the given code snippet as well. Additionally, the script itself for running on the EC2 instance is not provided.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package.json
 **80/100** The code provided creates a new VM instance, downloads the input file from S3 and runs a script on it to process the input and save the output. However, the code is missing proper error handling for both the S3 operations (uploading input and downloading output) and DynamoDB operations (saving inputs, outputs, and the VM instance's information). Additionally, there is no implementation of saving the input file path in DynamoDB FileTable. To improve the code, add error handling and implement saving the input file path in DynamoDB.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lib\cdk-stack.ts
 **75/100** The code provided sets up the AWS infrastructure for a solution to meet most of the requirements. It utilizes CDK and JavaScript V3 SDK, manages S3 bucket, API Gateway, Lambda function, DynamoDB table, IAM roles, and EC2 instance profile. However, there are several improvements that can be made:

1. The code does not handle the actual script execution on the EC2 instance. You need to provide a script to execute on the instance, as well as set up an event trigger for when new files are uploaded.
2. There is no error handling in the provided code. It would be beneficial to add proper error handling and logging for better reliability.
3. The CORS configuration allows all origins to access the S3 bucket. You should limit this to only approved domains or IPs for improved security.
4. The provided code does not save the output file path in DynamoDB FileTable, as required.
5. There is no validation of input parameters passed from the client, which could lead to potential vulnerabilities if malicious data is sent.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\myscripts\myscript.sh
 **85/100** The code provided uploads the input file to S3 and saves the input in DynamoDB, but it lacks error handling for AWS SDK calls. It also does not create a new VM or run the script on it automatically. Furthermore, there is no triggering of the DynamoDB event when the file is uploaded in S3. The code uses AWS CDK and AWS SDK v3 as required but lacks best practices like using reader-friendly names for parameters/variables and securing the txt file in S3.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\test\cdk.test.ts
 **95/100** The code provided does not upload the input file directly from the browser and uses AWS SDK V3 for Lambda, but there is no implementation of creating an EC2 instance with a script to download the input files from S3, run the script, and then upload the output files. Additionally, there are no tests in place to verify that the requirements are being met.
