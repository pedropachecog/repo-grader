# Analysis Report

**Note:** GPT-4

**Final evaluation:**

 **Average Grade: 37.14/100.** Consistently throughout the provided code files, the project does not fully meet all the given requirements such as file upload to S3, saving inputs in DynamoDB, triggering a script on EC2 VM instance and other AWS specific best practices.

## File by File Analysis

### ..\aws-challenge\README.md
**65/100**. This project shows effort in abstracting AWS infrastructure components to CDK and communicates with different AWS services. However, it lacks commitment to code quality, adherence to security best practices, and the provision of an end-to-end implementation.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\.npmignore
**0/100.** There is no code provided to evaluate against the given requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\cdk.json
**20/100.** The code provided is just a configuration for the CDK app and doesn't implement the required features such as file uploading, DynamoDB data management, and EC2 VM instance control.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\jest.config.js
**0/100**. The provided code is a Jest configuration object, which is not aligned with the system components and requirements given in the prompt.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package.json
**60/100.** The provided code only shows the package.json dependencies and scripts for a CDK project and doesn't include any logic to meet the stated requirements for interacting with services such as S3, DynamoDB, EC2 or using the AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\tsconfig.json
**0/100.** No implementation is provided in the code for any of the given requirements. The provided code snippet only contains TypeScript compiler options.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\bin\cdk.ts
**50/100**. The provided code fragment is a standard boilerplate for initializing an AWS CDK project, but it doesn't contain any logic for the S3 file upload, DynamoDB, or the necessary Lambda function as required.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\events_lambda.mjs
**45/100.** The code partially meets the requirements, but doesn't fully implement file upload to S3, saving inputs and S3 path to DynamoDB, triggering script on VM Instance, and executing required post-processing steps.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\index.mjs
**50/100.** The code successfully implements file upload to S3 and saves input in DynamoDB but does not trigger a script on a VM instance nor implements AWS CDK, violating multiple requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package-lock.json
**0/100.** The provided code is not complete â€“ it merely includes dependency information for a library, not any functional code to meet the described requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package.json
**0/100.** The provided code only includes a package dependency, and doesn't fulfill any of the given requirements, including the file upload to S3, saving inputs in DynamoDB, triggering a script on an EC2 VM, and others.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lib\cdk-stack.ts
**90/100**. The code written using AWS CDK in TypeScript to manage infrastructure meets most of the requirements, including uploading the script to S3, Lambda functions to save the inputs and S3 path to DynamoDB, and triggering a script run in an EC2 VM instance via a DynamoDB Event. It also adheres to AWS best practices: it doesn't use AWS Amplify backend, doesn't include any AWS access keys or credentials, and ensures parameter and variable names are reader-friendly. A small deduction of points for missing the code to make input file not publicly accessible on S3, and the missing implementation of the error handling for the VM creation and the script run.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\myscripts\myscript.sh
**60/100**. The provided code is a script that correctly retrieves inputs from DynamoDB, manipulates the data and updates DynamoDB with the output file path, but it doesn't demonstrate file upload to S3 from the browser, triggering of EC2 VM instance, use of API Gateway, a Lambda function, or AWS CDK, as required.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\test\cdk.test.ts
**0/100**. The code does not comply with the requirements as it only contains commented-out test code and does not address any of the specified requirements.
