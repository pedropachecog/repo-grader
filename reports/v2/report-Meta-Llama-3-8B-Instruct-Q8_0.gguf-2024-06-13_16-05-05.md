# Analysis Report

**Note:** Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf

**Final evaluation:**

 **90/100** The code provided partially meets the requirements by uploading files to S3, saving inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, triggering a script on an EC2 VM instance, and managing AWS infrastructure using CDK. However, it lacks error handling during script execution on the VM instance, does not ensure that the input file is not publicly accessible in S3, and does not automatically create a new VM instance before running the script. Additionally, some parameter and variable names could be more reader-friendly.

## File by File Analysis

### ..\aws-challenge\README.md
**70/100**. The code provides a comprehensive implementation of the system components, including File Upload to S3, Save Inputs and S3 Path in DynamoDB, and Trigger Script on VM Instance. It also utilizes AWS CDK for infrastructure management, Lambda for backend logic, and EC2 for running processing scripts. However, there are some issues with security best practices and variable naming conventions that need improvement. Additionally, the code lacks proper error handling and logging mechanisms, making it difficult to monitor and debug the application.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\.npmignore
**85/100** The code provided partially complies with the requirements by uploading files to S3, saving inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, triggering a script on an EC2 VM instance, and managing AWS infrastructure using CDK. However, it lacks error handling for script execution and does not ensure that the input file is not publicly accessible in S3.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\cdk.json
**60/100**
The provided code is partially compliant with the requirements. It successfully uploads files to S3 and saves inputs and S3 paths in DynamoDB using API Gateway and a Lambda function. However, it lacks proper error handling during script execution on the VM instance. Additionally, it does not automatically create a new VM instance before running the script, which is required by one of the requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\jest.config.js
**0/100**

The code provided does not meet the requirements, as it is a Jest configuration file and not the actual implementation of the system components specified in the requirements. It lacks any functionality related to uploading files to S3, saving inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, or triggering a script on an EC2 VM instance.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package-lock.json
This is a JSON file that lists the dependencies of a Node.js project, specifically the `node_modules` directory. Here's a breakdown of the contents:

**Root Object**

The root object is an object that contains information about the project and its dependencies.

* **name**: The name of the project (not specified in this example).
* **version**: The version of the project (not specified in this example).
* **dependencies**: An object that lists the project's dependencies.

**Dependencies**

The `dependencies` object is an object that contains information about each dependency, including:

* **name**: The name of the dependency.
* **version**: The version of the dependency.
* **resolved**: The URL from which the dependency was resolved (in this case, a GitHub repository).
* **integrity**: A hash of the dependency's contents to ensure integrity.
* **dev**: A boolean indicating whether the dependency is dev-only (i.e., not intended for production use).

Some notable dependencies in this list include:

* `@types/node`: TypeScript types for Node.js.
* `jest`: A testing framework for JavaScript.
* `ts-jest`: A plugin for Jest that allows it to work with TypeScript.
* `typescript`: The TypeScript compiler and runtime environment.
* `yargs`: A command-line parser library.

**Other Objects**

The rest of the objects in this JSON file are additional metadata about the project and its dependencies, such as funding information (e.g., "https://github.com/sponsors/sindresorhus") or engines supported by each dependency.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package.json
**85/100** The code provided meets the requirements for file upload to S3, saving inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, and triggering a script on a VM instance. However, it does not meet the requirement of using AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda (latest version) as it uses CDK v2 instead of CDK v3.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\tsconfig.json
**60/100** The code provided does not fully comply with the requirements as it lacks a complete implementation of all system components and other requirements. Specifically, the code is missing the API Gateway, Lambda function, DynamoDB table creation, EC2 VM instance creation and termination, script execution, and error handling mechanisms.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\bin\cdk.ts
**40/100**
The code provided does not meet the requirements as it only sets up a CDK stack and does not include the necessary functionality for file upload to S3, saving inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, triggering a script on a VM instance, or uploading outputs to S3. Additionally, it lacks AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda and proper error handling.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\events_lambda.mjs
**80/100**
The code provided meets the requirements for uploading a file to S3, saving inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, and triggering a script on a VM instance via a DynamoDB event. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed: 1) The code does not handle errors when downloading the input file from S3 or running the script; 2) The output file is not uploaded to S3 with a specific bucket name and key; 3) The code uses an instance profile ARN which should be replaced with a variable or environment variable.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\index.mjs
**75/100** The code provided meets most of the requirements, but there are some issues with triggering a script on an EC2 VM instance and handling errors during the script run. Additionally, it is recommended to use AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda instead of using the `@aws--sdk/client-dynamodb` package directly.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package-lock.json
**0/100** The code provided does not meet the requirements as it is a package.json file and does not contain any actual code that implements the specified system components or workflows. It only lists dependencies and their versions, but lacks the necessary implementation details.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package.json
**80/100**. The code meets most of the requirements, but there are some areas that need improvement. For example, it does not handle errors properly during the script run in the VM instance, and it does not ensure that the output file is uploaded to S3 successfully. Additionally, the parameter and variable names could be more reader-friendly.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lib\cdk-stack.ts
**80/100** The code provided does not fully meet the requirements. It creates an S3 bucket and uploads a script to it, but it does not create a DynamoDB table with the specified structure nor trigger a script run in an EC2 VM instance via a DynamoDB Event. Additionally, the IAM role for EC2 is created without any policies granting access to DynamoDB or S3. The code also lacks error handling and security best practices are not followed.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\myscripts\myscript.sh
**85/100**
The provided script does not directly meet the requirements, as it uses AWS CLI commands to interact with DynamoDB and S3, which is not recommended due to security concerns. Furthermore, the VM creation and termination logic is missing, and error handling is limited. However, it does correctly append input text to the downloaded input file and save it in a new output file, then uploads the output file to S3 and updates DynamoDB with the new output path.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\test\cdk.test.ts
**20/100** The code provided does not meet the requirements as it is a test file for CDK stack and does not contain any logic related to file upload, DynamoDB, Lambda function, or EC2 VM instance. It only contains imports and a single test case for an SQS queue.
