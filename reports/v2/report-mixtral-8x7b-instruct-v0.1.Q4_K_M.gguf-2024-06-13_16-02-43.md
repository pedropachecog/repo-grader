# Analysis Report

**Note:** mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf

**Final evaluation:**

  **75/100** The code provided creates and configures the necessary infrastructure but does not meet all of the requirements as there is no trigger or script execution on a VM instance after the file is uploaded to S3 and saved in DynamoDB. Additionally, error handling is unclear.

## File by File Analysis

### ..\aws-challenge\README.md
 85/100

The code provided meets most requirements for file upload to S3 and saving inputs in DynamoDB. However, there is no evidence of triggering a script run on an EC2 VM instance, and some minor improvements can be made on code organization and variable naming.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\.npmignore
 90/100
The code provided meets most of the requirements, but there is a lack of clarity about how the DynamoDB stream event triggers the EC2 instance and runs the script as described in the system workflow steps. Additionally, it seems that this code only sets up the infrastructure using CDK, but does not include the actual Lambda function code for saving inputs to DynamoDB or handling the S3 file upload trigger.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\cdk.json
 **80/100** The code provided creates the necessary infrastructure, but lacks functionality to trigger the script automatically after file upload and adding information to DynamoDB. It also does not handle error cases or automatic VM termination post-script completion.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\jest.config.js
 **80/100** The code provided includes the necessary components for file upload to S3, saving inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, and triggering a script run on an EC2 VM instance via a DynamoDB Event. However, it is unclear if the rest of the requirements such as AWS best practices for security, no AWS access keys or credentials in the code, use of AWS CDK to manage AWS infrastructure, latest version of AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda, and proper error handling have been met. It would require further analysis and testing to confirm compliance with these requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package-lock.json
 This appears to be a `package-lock.json` file for a Node.js project, which is used to manage the dependencies of the project. It includes information about each package that the project depends on, including its version number, resolved URL, and integrity checksum. The `dependencies` field indicates which packages are required by the project at runtime, while the `devDependencies` field lists packages that are only needed for development tasks such as testing or building the project. Additionally, the `peerDependencies` field lists packages that are recommended to be installed alongside this package, but not automatically installed unless explicitly specified in the top-level `dependencies`. The `integrity` field is used to verify that the package has not been tampered with or corrupted since it was published.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package.json
 **90/100** The code provided meets most of the requirements, but there are no details about how to create and trigger the script on a VM instance in DynamoDB Streams. Additionally, it is unclear if the output file is uploaded to S3 and saved in DynamoDB FileTable after the script is executed.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\tsconfig.json
 **60/100** The code provided sets up a DynamoDB table and an S3 bucket, but it does not include the implementation for file upload, Lambda function to save inputs in DynamoDB, triggering of the EC2 VM instance, or updating the database with outputs. The required AWS SDKs are imported but no functions utilizing them are present in the code.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\bin\cdk.ts
 **0/100** The code provided does not contain any S3 file upload or DynamoDB input saving functionality. It only initializes a CDK application and creates a new stack for it, but the required components are missing.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\events_lambda.mjs
 95/100 The code provided meets most of the requirements but lacks proper input validation and error handling. It also does not save outputs in DynamoDB FileTable or handle file download and appending.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\index.mjs
 **80/100** The code provided uploads the input file to S3 directly from the browser and saves the inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB upon receiving a POST request. However, it does not trigger a script run in an EC2 VM instance after the file is uploaded to S3 and the information is added to DynamoDB.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package-lock.json
 **65/100** The code provided does not meet several of the requirements, including:

- File upload to S3 directly from the browser is not shown.
- A Lambda function is used to save inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB instead of an API Gateway.
- There is no triggering of a script run in an EC2 VM instance via a DynamoDB Event.
- The code lacks AWS CDK for managing AWS infrastructure, AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda, and a proper error handling mechanism.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package.json
 85/100 The code provided meets most of the requirements, but there is no implementation for triggering a script run in an EC2 VM instance via a DynamoDB Event and there are no details about error handling. Additionally, it's unclear how the files will be uploaded to S3 or how the permissions for S3 objects will be set. The code also lacks documentation.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lib\cdk-stack.ts
 **75/100** The code provided creates and configures the necessary infrastructure including the S3 bucket, Lambda function, API Gateway, DynamoDB table, and IAM roles. However, it does not meet all of the requirements as there is no trigger or script execution on a VM instance after the file is uploaded to S3 and saved in DynamoDB. Also, it is unclear if the input data is being saved in the correct format in DynamoDB.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\myscripts\myscript.sh
 **80/100** The code provided is a Bash script that performs some of the required operations (retrieve input, download it from S3, process it and save back to S3) but lacks other important elements. There are no details about how infrastructure was deployed using AWS CDK nor about triggering this script in response to an event on DynamoDB Table. Also, there is no error handling for the CLI commands used in this script, or information about creating and terminating a VM instance as part of a workflow.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\test\cdk.test.ts
 **70/100** The code provided does not meet the requirements in full as it only demonstrates a test for an SQS Queue, which is not mentioned in the system components or other requirements. A CDK stack defining the necessary infrastructure (S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, Lambda function, and EC2 instance) with proper configurations, event triggers, and error handling should have been provided instead to be evaluated for a passing grade.
