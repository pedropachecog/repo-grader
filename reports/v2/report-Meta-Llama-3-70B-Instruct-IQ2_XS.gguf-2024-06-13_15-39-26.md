# Analysis Report

**Note:** Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-IQ2_XS.gguf

**Final evaluation:**

 **80/100**
The code provided partially meets the system component requirements by implementing a full-stack application that automates the processing of uploaded text files using AWS services such as S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, EC2, and CDK. However, there are some deviations from the requirements, for example, the script in the VM instance is not triggered automatically via a DynamoDB event, and the output file is not uploaded to S3 with the correct path format. Additionally, some aspects of the code, such as error handling and security best practices, may not fully comply with the requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\README.md
**80/100**

The code provided partially meets the requirements by implementing a full-stack application that automates the processing of uploaded text files using AWS services such as S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, EC2, and CDK. However, there are some deviations from the requirements, for example, the script in the VM instance is not triggered automatically via a DynamoDB event, and the output file is not uploaded to S3 with the correct path format. Additionally, some aspects of the code, such as error handling and security best practices, may not fully comply with the requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\.npmignore
**95/100**

The code provided partially meets the requirements, but lacks implementation of certain components such as the script running on the EC2 VM instance and DynamoDB Event trigger. The code provides a solid foundation for file upload to S3 and saving inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB using API Gateway and Lambda function, following AWS best practices for security. However, it falls short of implementing the entire workflow, including triggering the script on the VM instance and uploading the output file to S3.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\cdk.json
**0/100**

The provided code is a configuration file for a CDK project and does not meet any of the requirements specified. It appears to be a set of configurations for a CDK project, but it does not contain any code that implements the system components described in the requirements. The code does not upload a file to S3, save inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, trigger a script on an EC2 VM instance, or meet any of the other specified requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\jest.config.js
**0/100**

The provided code does not meet any of the requirements specified, as it appears to be a configuration file for Jest testing and does not contain any functionality related to uploading files to S3, saving inputs in DynamoDB, or triggering scripts on an EC2 VM instance. The code is also unrelated to AWS CDK, Lambda, or the AWS SDK JavaScript V3, which are required by the specifications.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package-lock.json
This is a JSON representation of the `node_modules` directory in a JavaScript project. It lists all the dependencies installed in the project, along with their versions and integrity hashes.

Here's a breakdown of the structure:

* The top-level object has a single property called `dependencies`, which is an object that contains all the dependencies.
* Each dependency is listed as a key-value pair, where the key is the name of the dependency (e.g. `"@swc/core"`) and the value is an object with information about the dependency.
* The dependency object has several properties:
	+ `version`: the version number of the dependency.
	+ `resolved`: the URL of the resolved package (usually a tarball).
	+ `integrity`: a hash of the package contents, used for integrity checking.
	+ `dev`: a boolean indicating whether the dependency is a development dependency.
	+ `engines`: an object specifying the minimum version of Node.js required to run the dependency.
	+ `funding`: an object with information about the funding model of the dependency (if applicable).

The dependencies are grouped into several categories:

* `node_modules/...`: these are top-level dependencies installed in the project.
* `node_modules/.../node_modules/...`: these are dependencies installed within other dependencies.

Note that this is just a snapshot of the `node_modules` directory at a particular point in time. The actual directory may contain more or fewer dependencies, depending on how the project evolves over time.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package.json
**20/100**

The code provided does not meet the requirements as it only includes a `package.json` file with dependencies and scripts, but lacks the implementation of the system components specified in the requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\tsconfig.json
**0/100**

The provided code does not meet any of the requirements, as it appears to be a TypeScript configuration file and does not contain any implementation of the required system components. The code is unrelated to the specified requirements, which involve uploading files to S3, saving inputs in DynamoDB, triggering scripts on EC2 VM instances, and more.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\bin\cdk.ts
**0/100**
The provided code does not meet the requirements as it only sets up a CDK stack but does not implement any of the required system components, such as file upload to S3, saving inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, triggering a script on an EC2 VM instance, or uploading the output file to S3.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\events_lambda.mjs
**60/100**

The code provided partially meets the requirements. It appears to create an EC2 instance and upload a script to it, but there are several issues:

* The code does not handle file uploads to S3 or save inputs and S3 paths in DynamoDB.
* The script workflow in the VM instance is not implemented (e.g., retrieving inputs from DynamoDB, downloading the input file, running the script, uploading the output file).
* The code does not follow best practices for security, such as using environment variables instead of hardcoding values like `instanceProfileArn`.
* There are no error handling mechanisms in place to handle scenarios where the EC2 instance creation fails or the script execution fails.
* The code is not organized into separate functions and variables are not named in a reader-friendly manner.

To meet the requirements, the code needs to be refactored to include file upload to S3, saving inputs and S3 paths in DynamoDB, and implementing the script workflow in the VM instance. Additionally, security best practices should be followed, and error handling mechanisms should be put in place.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\index.mjs
**70/100**

The code provided partially meets the requirements. It successfully uploads a file to S3 and saves the input text and S3 path in DynamoDB. However, it does not trigger a script run on an EC2 VM instance, which is a crucial part of the system component. Additionally, there are some security concerns as the txt file in S3 is publicly accessible, which is against one of the requirements. The code also lacks error handling for DynamoDB operations and does not follow some AWS best practices.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package-lock.json
**0/100**

The provided code does not meet the requirements as it only contains a `package.json` file with dependencies, but no actual implementation of the system components. There is no code for uploading files to S3, saving inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, triggering a script on an EC2 VM instance, or any other component described in the requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package.json
**80/100**

The code provided partially meets the requirements by not including a file upload to S3 directly from the browser and using AWS CDK to manage infrastructure, but lacks implementation of key components such as saving inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, triggering a script run in an EC2 VM instance, and handling errors.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lib\cdk-stack.ts
**60/100**

The code provided partially meets the requirements. It sets up an S3 bucket, a Lambda function, and an API Gateway, and it also creates a DynamoDB table and grants the necessary permissions to the Lambda function. However, there are several issues:

* The code does not upload a file to S3 directly from the browser. Instead, it uses an API Gateway and a Lambda function to handle the file upload.
* The code does not trigger a script run in an EC2 VM instance via a DynamoDB event. It creates an IAM role and an instance profile for EC2, but it does not create an EC2 instance or trigger a script to run on it.
* The code does not download the input file from S3 to the VM, append the retrieved input text to the downloaded input file, and upload the output file to S3.
* The code does not save the outputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable.

To fully meet the requirements, the code needs to be significantly modified to address these issues.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\myscripts\myscript.sh
**70/100**
The code provided partially meets the requirements by running a script on an EC2 VM instance, downloading the input file from S3, appending the input text to the downloaded file, and uploading the output file to S3. However, it does not meet some crucial requirements such as using AWS CDK to manage infrastructure, following AWS best practices for security, and ensuring that the txt file in S3 is not publicly accessible. Additionally, the code uses AWS SDK V1 instead of V3, and does not include error handling or proper parameter and variable naming conventions.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\test\cdk.test.ts
**0/100**

The code provided does not meet the requirements as it appears to be a test file for an SQS queue and has no relation to the system components specified in the requirements. There is no implementation of file upload to S3, saving inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB, or triggering a script on a VM instance. The code seems to be unrelated to the task at hand.
