# Analysis Report

**Note:** GPT-4-Turbo

**Final evaluation:**

 **39/100.** The average evaluation across various components indicates partial implementation of the system requirements, but significant functionalities related to VM handling, complete AWS SDK v3 integration, and AWS CDK deployed workflows are missing.

## File by File Analysis

### ..\aws-challenge\README.md
**85/100**. The code fulfills most requirements, including using AWS services for backend processes, deploying via CDK, and not including AWS keys explicitly, but it lacks clear details on security implementations for S3 file access and DynamoDB entries.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\.npmignore
**0/100.** The code provided does not fulfill any specified requirements; it only contains configuration for ignored files and directories.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\cdk.json
**0/100.** The provided content is a configuration file for AWS CDK and does not contain any functional code to evaluate against the requirements listed.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\jest.config.js
**0/100.** The provided code is a Jest configuration file for a Node.js project and does not implement any of the required functionalities related to AWS services or system components.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package.json
**50/100.** The provided JSON manifests dependency management for a TypeScript CDK project, but does not contain any operational logic or code to meet the stated requirements regarding S3, DynamoDB, or EC2 functionalities.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\tsconfig.json
**0/100.** The provided TypeScript compiler configuration file does not include any actual code to analyze against the requirements specified.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\bin\cdk.ts
**30/100**. The code initializes a CDK application but does not implement any of the required functionalities such as S3 uploads, DynamoDB operations, or triggering EC2 instances.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\events_lambda.mjs
**45/100.** The code only addresses the triggering of a script on a VM instance on EC2 upon a DynamoDB Event, while missing the S3 file upload, DynamoDB save, and no AWS SDK v3 usage verification is evident.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\index.mjs
**55/100.** The code correctly handles S3 file uploading with presigned URL and entries addition to DynamoDB, but lacks the functionalities related to EC2 VM instance triggering, and script execution upon DynamoDB event.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package-lock.json
**0/100.** The code provided does not meet any of the specified requirements related to AWS services or system components integration.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package.json
**0/100.** The provided JSON snippet only shows a package dependency and does not contain any implementation details relevant to the requirements specified.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lib\cdk-stack.ts
**85/100.** The code handles the setup for S3, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB appropriately but does not address the automatic creation of a new VM or the overall script workflow execution as detailed in the requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\myscripts\myscript.sh
**50/100.** The code handles the script running on the VM (including DynamoDB and S3 operations), but it lacks any implementation details for file upload handling, API Gateway, Lambda usage, and no setup via AWS CDK is evident.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\test\cdk.test.ts
**0/100.** The code provided does not address any of the specified requirements related to S3, DynamoDB, the VM script workflow, security practices, or AWS CDK usage.
