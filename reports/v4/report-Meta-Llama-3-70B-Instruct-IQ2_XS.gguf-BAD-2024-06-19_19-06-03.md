# Analysis Report

**Note:** Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-IQ2_XS.gguf-BAD

**Final evaluation:**

 **70/100**

The project partially complies with the requirements, but has some critical security issues and minor implementation flaws.

Complies with requirements: 2, 3, 5
Violates requirements: 1, 4

General evaluation: The main script (main.py) is well-structured and follows best practices, but the config.py file commits a serious security risk by hardcoding the API key. This should be read from an .env file to prevent exposing sensitive information. Additionally, the main script hardcodes prompts instead of reading them from config.py, which is a minor issue. The project has potential, but it needs significant refactoring to ensure security and compliance with requirements.

Note: The overall grade is calculated by considering both the individual evaluations and the holistic evaluation of the project. In this case, the main script (main.py) scores high due to its well-structured code, but the config.py file's security risk and the hardcoding of prompts in main.py bring down the overall score.

## File by File Analysis

### ..\horde-client-bad\config.py
**0/100**

Complies with requirements: None

Violates requirements: 1

General evaluation: The code violates requirement 1 by committing the API key to the repo, which is a security risk. The API key should be read from an .env file instead of being hard-coded in the config.py file.

### ..\horde-client-bad\main.py
**95/100**

Complies with requirements:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Violates requirements:
None

General evaluation: The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It reads the Horde API key from an .env file (not shown in this code snippet), uses a config.py file to store configurable values, saves the image into a subfolder specified in config.py, and retries getting the generated image until a certain timeout happens. However, it hardcodes the prompts in the main script instead of reading them from config.py, which is a minor issue.
