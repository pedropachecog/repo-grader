# Analysis Report

**Note:** Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-IQ2_XS.gguf-BAD

**Final evaluation:**

 **60/100**

The project partially complies with the requirements. It meets some of the key requirements, such as using an auxiliary file to store configuration values (requirement 2), specifying a subfolder to save images into (requirement 3), and defining timeout and retry intervals (requirement 5). However, it fails to read the Horde API Key from an `.env` file (requirement 1) and instead hardcodes it in the `config.py` file. Additionally, the project does not fully implement requirement 4 as it reads prompts from `config.py`, but the main script could still be improved to better separate concerns.

The project's strength lies in its ability to follow best practices and structure code in a well-organized manner. However, it falls short in terms of security and configuration management, which are critical aspects of any project.

## File by File Analysis

### ..\horde-client-bad\config.py
**40/100**

Complies with requirements: 2, 3, 5
Violates requirements: 1

General evaluation: The code file `config.py` meets some of the requirements, such as using an auxiliary file to store configuration values (requirement 2), specifying a subfolder to save images into (requirement 3), and defining timeout and retry intervals (requirement 5). However, it violates requirement 1 by committing the Horde API key to the repo. The API key should be read from an `.env` file instead of being hardcoded in the `config.py` file.

### ..\horde-client-bad\main.py
**90/100**

Complies with requirements: 2,3,4,5
Violates requirements: None

General evaluation: The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It uses an auxiliary file config.py to make it easier to change values (requirement 2), reads prompts from config.py instead of hardcoding them in the main script (requirement 4), saves the image downloaded into a subfolder specified in config.py (requirement 3), and retries getting the generated image until a certain timeout happens with both timeout and retry interval defined in config.py (requirement 5). However, it does not read Horde API Key from an .env file (requirement 1).
