# Analysis Report

**Note:** Codestral-22B-v0.1.Q8_0.gguf-BAD

**Final evaluation:**

 **90/100**/n
Complies with requirements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (main.py) /n
Violates requirements: 1 (config.py) /n
General evaluation: The project mostly complies with the requirements. However, there's a security risk in config.py where an API key is hardcoded which violates requirement 1. To achieve full compliance and better security practices, it's recommended to remove the hardcoded API key from config.py and rely solely on reading from the .env file.

## File by File Analysis

### ..\horde-client-bad\config.py
**80/100**/n
Complies with requirements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 /n
Violates requirements: None /n
General evaluation: The code reads the Horde API key from an .env file as required. It uses a config.py file to store all configuration values, making it easy to modify them. However, the hardcoded API key in the config.py file violates requirement 1 which states not to commit the API key to your repo. This can lead to security risks if the .env file is not properly managed.

### ..\horde-client-bad\main.py
**100/100**/n Complies with requirements: 1,2,3,4,5 /n Violates requirements: None /n General evaluation: The code complies with all the provided requirements by utilizing an .env file for API key security, a config.py file for easy value modification, saving images into specified subfolders, reading prompts from config.py and implementing retries with timeout values also defined in config.py. Well-structured and follows best practices.
