# Analysis Report

**Note:** Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-IQ2_XS.gguf-BAD

**Final evaluation:**

 **70/100**

The project partially fulfills the requirements, with some major security risks and omissions.

Complies with requirements: 2, 3, 4, 5

Violates requirements: 1

General evaluation: The project has a good structure and uses an auxiliary file `config.py` to make it easier to change values. It also defines the subfolder to save the image into and retries getting the generated image until a certain timeout happens. However, it hardcodes the Horde API key in the `config.py` file, which is a major security risk. Additionally, the project does not fully fulfill requirements 4 as it does not read prompts from `config.py`, but rather defines default base and negative prompts.

Major areas for improvement include:

* Reading the Horde API Key from an `.env` file instead of hardcoding it in `config.py`.
* Defining how to handle retries in case of failures.
* Reading prompts from `config.py` instead of defining default values.

Overall, while the project has a good structure and partially fulfills the requirements, it has major security risks and omissions that need to be addressed.

## File by File Analysis

### ..\horde-client-bad\config.py
**60/100**

Complies with requirements: 2, 3, 5
Violates requirements: 1

General evaluation: The code is well-structured and makes use of an auxiliary file config.py to make it easier to change values. It also defines the subfolder to save the image into and retries getting the generated image until a certain timeout happens. However, it hardcodes the Horde API key in the config.py file, which is a major security risk. This should be read from an .env file instead.

Note: The code does not fulfill requirements 4 as it does not read prompts from config.py, but rather defines default base and negative prompts. It also does not define how to handle retries in case of failures, which might be part of the requirement 5.

### ..\horde-client-bad\main.py
**90/100**

Complies with requirements: 2, 3, 4, 5

Violates requirements: None

General evaluation: The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It uses an auxiliary file `config.py` to make it easier to change values, reads prompts from `config.py`, saves the image downloaded into a subfolder specified in `config.py`, and retries getting the generated image until a certain timeout happens. However, it does not read Horde API Key from an `.env` file, instead using `Config.HORDE_API_KEY` which is not in compliance with requirement 1.
