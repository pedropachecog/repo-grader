# Analysis Report

**Note:** Codestral-22B-v0.1-Q6_K.gguf-BAD

**Final evaluation:**

 **84/100**/n Complies with requirements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (partially) /n Violates requirements: None explicitly /n General evaluation: The project follows best practices and meets most of the specified requirements. However, it only partially implements requirement 5 as it does not define both a timeout value and a retry limit in config.py for getting the generated image. This could lead to potential issues if the application continuously tries to retrieve an image without stopping after a certain period or number of attempts.

## File by File Analysis

### ..\horde-client-bad\config.py
**60/100**/n Complies with requirements: 1, 2, 3, 4 /n Violates requirements: 5 /n General evaluation: The code meets most of the requirements but does not implement retrying for getting the generated image until a timeout. It's important to handle such cases for better reliability and efficiency in applications.<|eot_id|>

### ..\horde-client-bad\main.py
**98/100**/n Complies with requirements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 /n Violates requirements: None /n General evaluation: The code follows the best practices and meets all the specified requirements. It reads the API key from an .env file, uses config.py to store values, saves images into a subfolder, reads prompts from config.py, and retries getting the image until a certain timeout defined in config.py.
