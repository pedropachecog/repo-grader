# Analysis Report

**Note:** Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-IQ2_XS.gguf-BAD

**Final evaluation:**

 **70/100**

The project partially complies with the requirements. 

Complies with requirements: 2, 3, 4, 5
Violates requirements: 1

General evaluation: While individual files demonstrate good practices and structure, the project as a whole falls short in meeting critical security requirements. The Horde API key is not read from an `.env` file, which poses a serious security risk. Additionally, prompts are not read from `config.py` in one of the files, further compromising the project's compliance with requirements. However, the project does well in separating configuration into a separate file and using it to store values that should not be hardcoded, and it retries getting the generated image until a certain timeout happens.

## File by File Analysis

### ..\horde-client-bad\config.py
**60/100**

Complies with requirements: 2, 3, 5
Violates requirements: 1

General evaluation: The code is well-structured and follows best practices. However, it explicitly violates requirement 1 by committing the Horde API key to the config file, which is a serious security risk. Additionally, while the code does define some parameters for image generation and retrieval, it does not read prompts from the config file as required in requirement 4.

### ..\horde-client-bad\main.py
**90/100**

Complies with requirements: 2, 3, 4, 5

Violates requirements: None

General evaluation: The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It separates configuration into a separate file (`config.py`) and uses it to store values that should not be hardcoded. It also retries getting the generated image until a certain timeout happens, as required. However, it does not read the Horde API key from an `.env` file, which is a critical security requirement.
