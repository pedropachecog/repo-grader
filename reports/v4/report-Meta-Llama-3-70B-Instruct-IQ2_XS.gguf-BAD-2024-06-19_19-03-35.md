# Analysis Report

**Note:** Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-IQ2_XS.gguf-BAD

**Final evaluation:**

 **60/100**

The project partially complies with the requirements. The main script (`main.py`) is well-structured and follows best practices, but the configuration file (`config.py`) has some issues.

Complies with requirements: 2,3,4,5
Violates requirements: 1

General evaluation: While the project meets some of the requirements, it falls short in terms of reading the Horde API key from an `.env` file. This is a critical security requirement that should not be ignored. The configuration file (`config.py`) hardcodes the API key instead of reading it from an `.env` file, which is a major violation. Additionally, the prompts are hardcoded in `main.py` instead of being read from `config.py`. However, the project does well in terms of separating configuration values into a separate file and using them correctly.

Overall, the project needs to improve in terms of securing sensitive information like API keys and reading configuration values correctly.

## File by File Analysis

### ..\horde-client-bad\config.py
**40/100**
Complies with requirements: 2,3,5
Violates requirements: 1
General evaluation: The code does not comply with requirement 1 as it hardcodes the API key instead of reading it from an .env file. It also does not read prompts from the config.py but instead hardcodes them. However, it defines some parameters and values in the config.py as required by requirements 2,3,5.

### ..\horde-client-bad\main.py
**90/100**

Complies with requirements: 2, 3, 4, 5

Violates requirements: None

General evaluation: The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It separates configuration values into a separate file (`config.py`) and uses them correctly. It also retries image generation until a timeout occurs as specified in the config file. However, it does not read the Horde API key from an `.env` file as required by requirement 1.
