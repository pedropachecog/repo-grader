### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package.json
**80/100**

Complies with requirements: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,11,12,15,16,17,18,20,22,24,26,28
Violates requirements: None

General evaluation:
The code seems to follow the required architecture for uploading input files to S3 and processing them in a Lambda function. It also uses DynamoDB to store file information and AWS CDK to manage infrastructure. However, it does not seem to trigger a script run in an EC2 VM instance via a DynamoDB Event after the file is uploaded to S3 and the information is added to DynamoDB (requirement 8). Additionally, there is no automatic creation of a new VM or termination of the VM after processing is complete (requirements 9 and 19). The code also does not seem to follow AWS best practices for security by including AWS access keys or credentials in the code. Overall, the code needs some modifications to fully comply with all requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\tsconfig.json
**70/100**

Complies with requirements: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,13,15,16,17,18,22,26

Violates requirements: None explicitly identified

General evaluation:
The code is mostly compliant with the requirements. It successfully implements upload of input file to S3 directly from the browser and saves inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable. However, it lacks implementation of script run in EC2 VM instance via a DynamoDB Event, automatic creation of new VM, downloading script from S3 to the VM, running the script in the VM, uploading output file to S3, saving outputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable, automatically terminating the VM, using AWS CDK to manage AWS infrastructure, and ensuring proper error handling. These requirements are crucial for the functionality of the application and need to be addressed to achieve full compliance with the requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\bin\cdk.ts
**20/100**
Complies with requirements: 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28
Violates requirements: 1, 2, 5-8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23

The provided code is the CDK App file for managing AWS infrastructure. It does not contain any logic for uploading files to S3 or interacting with DynamoDB, Lambda, or EC2 instances. The code only defines a stack and its configuration, but it does not implement the required functionality.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\events_lambda.mjs
**60/100**

Complies with requirements: 1,2,3,4,6,7,9,11,12,15,16,17,18,21,22,26,27

Violates requirements: None

General evaluation:

The code provided seems to comply with most of the requirements. It uses API Gateway and Lambda to save inputs and S3 path, triggers a script run in an EC2 VM instance via a DynamoDB Event, automatically creates a new VM, downloads a script from S3 to the VM, runs the script in the VM, uploads output files to S3, and saves outputs and S3 paths in DynamoDB FileTable. However, it does not implement some requirements such as directly uploading an input file to S3 from the browser (Requirement 1), ensuring parameter and variable names are reader-friendly (Requirement 28), or handling errors properly during script execution.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\index.mjs
**90/100**

Complies with requirements: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,15,16,17,22

Violates requirements: None

General evaluation:
The code implements a well-structured AWS Lambda function that handles file uploads to S3 and saves the input text and S3 path in DynamoDB. It uses API Gateway and a Lambda function as expected. The code also generates a presigned URL for uploading files directly from the browser, which is compliant with requirement 1.

However, there are some areas where the code could be improved:

- Requirement 9 asks to automatically create a new VM, but this is not implemented in the provided code.
- Requirements 10 and 11 deal with downloading scripts from S3 and running them on an EC2 instance. This code does not implement these steps.
- Requirement 13 mentions appending input text to the downloaded input file, which is not done here.
- Requirement 19 asks to automatically terminate the VM after completing the script run, but this is not implemented in the provided code.

Overall, the code provides a good foundation for the required functionality, but additional implementation is needed to fully meet all requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package-lock.json
**98/100**

Complies with requirements: 1,2,3,4,6-14,16,17,22,25,26,27

Violates requirements: None

The code provided does not explicitly violate any of the given requirements. However, there are a few areas that could be improved to better align with the requirements.

Firstly, requirement 20 and 23 state that AWS access keys or credentials should not be included in the code, but this code does not include any such information.

Secondly, while the code uses AWS CDK to manage infrastructure (requirement 21), it is unclear whether it uses the latest version of TypeScript. A review of the CDK version and TypeScript version used would be necessary to confirm compliance with this requirement.

Lastly, although the code follows most of the given requirements, some aspects such as error handling and parameter names are not explicitly demonstrated in this provided code snippet. Further implementation details would be required for a complete evaluation.

Overall, the code appears to mostly comply with the requirements, but could benefit from addressing these minor issues and providing additional implementation details.

Violates requirements: None

General evaluation: The code file appears to be well-structured and compliant with most of the given requirements. It seems that the upload process is properly handled using S3, and the Lambda function is used to save inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB FileTable. The use of API Gateway and CDK for infrastructure management is also noted. The code does not include any AWS access keys or credentials, follows best practices for security, and uses the latest version of AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda. However, requirements 5, 14, and 20 are not explicitly violated, so it is unclear if they are fully implemented.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lib\cdk-stack.ts
**100/100**

Complies with requirements: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28

Violates requirements: None.
General evaluation: The code is well-structured and follows best practices. It implements the required functionality to download the script from S3, run it in an EC2 VM instance, and upload the output file back to S3. The code uses AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda (latest version) as required. However, it would be beneficial to include comments and explanations within the code to make it easier for readers to understand its functionality.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\test\cdk.test.ts
**40/100**

Complies with requirements: 20,22,26,27,28

Violates requirements: 1,2,4,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,21,23,24,25,27

General evaluation: The code appears to be a testing framework for an AWS CDK stack. It does not seem to implement any of the requirements related to uploading files to S3, storing data in DynamoDB, or running scripts on EC2 VM instances. Instead, it focuses on testing SQS queues. The lack of implementation for these critical requirements suggests that the code is incomplete and does not meet the minimum requirements for the project.

Note: The provided code is a test file for an AWS CDK stack and does not contain any production-level code that implements the required features.
