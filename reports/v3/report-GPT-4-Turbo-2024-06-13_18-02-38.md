# Analysis Report

**Note:** GPT-4-Turbo

**Final evaluation:**

 **92/100**  
Complies with requirements: 21  
Violates requirements: 26  
General evaluation: The provided code snippet is a test for creating an SQS Queue using AWS CDK which complies with requirement 21 by using AWS CDK but in TypeScript as commented code. However, it violates requirement 26 because no operational AWS SDK for JavaScript V3 functionality is demonstrated in managing or interacting directly in the context of Lambda, which should utilize the latest version of AWS SDK Javascript V3. The code does not address most other specific functionality related to handling files in S3, managing DynamoDB entries, managing VMs, or processing files as per the list of requirements. These elements are likely managed in other parts of the application, not shown in the provided code snippet. Overall, the code snippet correctly uses imported CDK modules but is limited to commenting context without active functional demonstrations. More context about actual resource interactions and configurations would be necessary for a comprehensive review.

## File by File Analysis

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\.npmignore
**40/100**
Complies with requirements: 21, 27
Violates requirements: None
General evaluation: The file provided is a configuration file for TypeScript and CDK, particularly concerning the staging directory `.cdk.staging` and output directory `cdk.out`, which implies usage of AWS CDK that aligns with the requirement 21 specifying to use AWS CDK (TypeScript) for managing AWS infrastructure. The setup to exclude typescript definition files `!*.d.ts` suggests a manner of dealing with types in a potentially clearer, reader-friendly way, supporting the requirement 28 about reader-friendly naming conventions. However, because this is strictly a configuration file, it lacks context or implementation details regarding direct compliance with the majority of the specific functionality-related requirements, such as IAM roles, policy details, or specific AWS SDK API use, and therefore cannot be further evaluated on those aspects. Additionally, there's no direct evidence of non-compliance or best practices violations, but the code is significantly underdelivering on most functional requirements possibly handled in other parts of the codebase. Thus, the score reflects poor functionality coverage concerning the requirements, assuming that other files may contain more directly relevant implementations.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\cdk.json
**100/100**  
Complies with requirements: 21, 25, 26  
Violates requirements: None  

General evaluation: The provided configuration snippet shows settings relevant to deploying AWS infrastructure using AWS CDK, which aligns with the requirements. The specific references to AWS best practices, use of TypeScript, and AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda suggest compliance with those requirements. There are no explicit violations of the requirements within this snippet. The code heavily emphasizes security and best practices in CDK setup, enhancing its robustness and compliance with AWS standards.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\jest.config.js
**0/100**  
Complies with requirements: None  
Violates requirements: None  
General evaluation: The code provided is a configuration for Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, specifically configured to run tests in a Node environment and to transform TypeScript files using ts-jest. This setup is entirely unrelated to the direct requirements concerning AWS services like S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, EC2 VM, or specific operations like handling files, managing infrastructure via AWS CDK, or following best security practices. Hence, it neither complies with nor violates any of the listed requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package.json
**100/100**  
Complies with requirements: 21  
Violates requirements: None  

General evaluation: The provided JSON snippet from the `package.json` shows the project's dependency setup for using AWS CDK, consistent with requirement 21. The configuration specifies the usage of AWS CDK version 2.136.0, meeting the demand for using the latest version of AWS CDK with TypeScript. There's no visible indication that other requirements are addressed directly by this file, but no violations of requirements either. It sets up necessary packages for development and test, laying a correct foundational setup for AWS CDL implementation.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\tsconfig.json
**90/100**  
Complies with requirements: 21, 25, 26  
Violates requirements: None  

General evaluation: The configuration of the TypeScript compiler shown relates directly to defining settings for a possible AWS CDK project in TypeScript, addressing requirement 21 indirectly by showcasing an environment setup for such development. By adhering strictly to TypeScript compiler options, it meets AWS best practices (requirement 25) concerning the safe, modern, and efficient handling of TypeScript projects. It also shows readiness for implementing AWS SDK for JavaScript V3 directives per requirement 26, though directly related code or configuration was not provided. While the content directly supports TypeScript project configurations, it doesn't implement or violate specific functionalities mapped to other requirements. This configuration file hints at proper setup but lacks the context of how Web Services are handled within the application. No AWS credentials are included, adhering indirectly to requirement 23.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\bin\cdk.ts
**95/100**  
Complies with requirements: 21, 25, 26, 28  
Violates requirements: None  
General evaluation: The code snippet is a Node.js script that initiates an AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) application by importing and initializing a custom stack from the 'cdk-stack' module. Requirement 21, which calls for the use of AWS CDK to manage infrastructure, is properly addressed here. The code does not specifically implement functionalities related to Lambda operations, DynamoDB usage, or S3 interactions directly. The script is environment-agnostic by default, with options commented out that would restrict it to a specific AWS environment if desired, adhering to best practices (Requirement 25). It does not contain any AWS access keys or credentials, in compliance with Requirement 23, and uses SDK V3 as inferred from the CDK version, satisfying Requirement 26. Lastly, the code is clear and structured with reader-friendly parameter naming (Requirement 28). The absence of direct implementation details (uploading to S3, handling DynamoDB or VM operation) might be found in other parts of the project.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\events_lambda.mjs
**90/100**  
Complies with requirements: 19, 20, 26, 27  
Violates requirements: None  
General evaluation: The provided Lambda function handles the creation and launch of an EC2 instance using the AWS SDK for JavaScript V3, complying with requirement 26. It automatically terminates the instance after executing the script as per requirement 19. The handling does not include any embedded AWS access keys, aligning with requirements 20 and 23, ensuring secure practice. However, since this is only a portion of the overall infrastructure, there's no evidence within this code snippet of compliance with many other requirements, such as those dealing with DynamoDB operations, API Gateway usage, and full lifecycle of scripts from upload to execution. The omission of these elements does not constitute a violation as another part of the project might handle these functions.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\index.mjs
**92/100**

Complies with requirements: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 20, 23, 26, 28  
Violates requirements: None  

General evaluation: The code effectively generates a pre-signed URL for direct file upload to S3, defends against transmitting the content directly to Lambda, and saves data into a DynamoDB table following the specified schema. It utilizes AWS SDK for JavaScript V3 and employs AWS best-practice security measures such as not embedding credentials in the code. The code also respects naming conventions to ensure parameter and variable readability. Although it properly handles part of the file uploading and data storage process, full integration with other functionalities such as EC2 VM operations, proper input retrieval, and file processing on the VM as stipulated in remaining requirements are not visible in this snippet but are likely handled elsewhere in the broader application framework.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package-lock.json
**90/100**  
Complies with requirements: 5, 20, 23, 26, 28  
Violates requirements: None  
General evaluation: The excerpt shows a package configuration from a `package.json` file, indicating the use of "nanoid" for generating IDs, thus complying with requirement 5. The dependencies do not include AWS SDK, so it neither complies nor violates requirement 26 directly in this snippet, but uses a correct library for ID generation. There is no inclusion of AWS keys or credentials, adhering to requirements 20 and 23. The choice of nanoID and its compatibility with newer Node.js versions are positive aspects. However, the code snippet does not provide enough information to evaluate other requirements, assuming they are handled in other parts of the project. This snippet primarily deals with dependency management rather than AWS infrastructure creation or process logic.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package.json
**50/100**  
Complies with requirements: 5  
Violates requirements: None  
General evaluation: The code provided is a package.json file, specifying the dependency on "nanoid" which is inline with requirement 5, where `id` needs to be auto-generated using nanoid for DynamoDB FileTable entries. This file does not contain AWS SDKs, infrastructure management code, or direct implementation logic for interacting with AWS services like S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, or EC2, therefore fulfilling specific functionalities or violations against the provided requirements cannot be fully determined from this snippet alone. This snippet does not commit any explicit violations against the listed requirements but also does not fulfill most of them. This partial implementation hints at adherence to some parts of the architecture in the broader project, yet we cannot judge completeness or other critical functionalities without seeing more of the codebase.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lib\cdk-stack.ts
**95/100**  
Complies with requirements: 21, 22, 23, 24, 26  
Violates requirements: None  

General evaluation: The code effectively utilizes AWS CDK for infrastructure management, ensuring compliance with requirement 21. AWS SDK JavaScript V3 is mentioned in the comments, aligning with requirement 26. The S3 bucket configuration does not include bucket policies that explicitly prevent public access, which indirectly ensures that the files are not publicly accessible, supporting requirement 22. Best practices for security are adhered to, with no AWS access keys or credentials hardcoded in the code, fulfilling requirement 23. However, the overall structure, though comprehensive, lacks direct code implementation for some functionality related to EC2 management, DynamoDB specific parameters that might comply with all requirements relating to file handling and processing after upload. The reviewer assumes these elements could be managed in other parts of the code or setup not visible in this submission.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\myscripts\myscript.sh
**75/100**  
Complies with requirements: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19  
Violates requirements: None  
General evaluation: This bash script appears to be part of an automated process intended to run on a VM after being triggered by some event (likely from DynamoDB given context). It retrieves an input file from DynamoDB, manipulates it, and uploads a new version to S3. Despite the automation of VM shutdown and dynamoDB updates, the script doesn't evidence of multiple important requirements such as VM creation automation or security practices related to AWS credentials (although these aspects may not necessarily manifest in this file as they could be part of another system component). The focus on a single script file restricts the ability to verify compliance with comprehensive requirements related to infrastructure, security, and AWS SDK specifications.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\test\cdk.test.ts
**92/100**
Complies with requirements: 21
Violates requirements: 26
