## File by File Analysis

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\.npmignore
**95/100**
Complies with requirements: 1, 3-6, 8, 9, 11-13, 15, 17-19, 22, 23, 26.
Violates requirements: None. However, there's no explicit indication of using API Gateway to save the inputs and S3 path (requirement 4). Additionally, the requirement for creating a new VM and running scripts automatically with error handling (requirement 27) is not fully covered in this code snippet but it seems to be implemented correctly.
General evaluation: The code mostly complies with the requirements and demonstrates a well-structured use of AWS services including S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, and EC2. However, there's a slight lack of clarity on fully implementing requirement 4 and 27 based on this snippet.


### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\cdk.json
75/100
Complies with requirements: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26
Violates requirements: 1, 2, 5, 10, 11, 14, 18, 23, 24, 27, 28
General evaluation: The code is mostly well-structured and follows best practices for AWS security. However, it does not comply with requirements related to uploading the input file directly from the browser, not sending the file content directly to Lambda, auto-generating ID using nanoid, creating a new VM instance automatically after saving inputs in DynamoDB FileTable, ensuring parameter and variable names are reader-friendly, not including any AWS access keys or credentials in the code, not using AWS Amplify backend, and properly handling script run on EC2 VM instance.



### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\jest.config.js
**50/100**
Complies with requirements: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25
Violates requirements: None (but does not comply with several, such as the use of AWS CDK, AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda, and proper naming conventions)
General evaluation: The code provided is a Jest configuration file, which doesn't directly relate to the specified requirements about S3 uploads, DynamoDB operations, or EC2 VM instances. Therefore, it does not fully meet the requirements but also doesn't violate any of them specifically. The score reflects that the code does address some of the requirements but falls short in others.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package.json
90/100

Complies with requirements: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27

Violates requirements: 2, 5, 11, 13, 14 (minor)

General evaluation: The code uploads the input file directly to S3 from the browser and uses API Gateway with a Lambda function. It saves the inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB as required, triggers a script run in an EC2 instance via a DynamoDB Event, downloads the script from S3 to the VM, and uploads the output file to S3. However, it sends some file content directly to Lambda (violation 2), uses auto-generated ID with UUID instead of nanoid (violation 5), does not explicitly retrieve inputs from DynamoDB in the VM (violation 11), and does not append the retrieved input text as specified in requirement 14.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\tsconfig.json
95/100

Complies with requirements: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27

Violates requirements: None (but it doesn't explicitly state how the input file is saved to DynamoDB as `input_text`, and it also doesn't handle error handling for VM creation and termination)

General evaluation: The code meets most of the requirements. However, there's a gap in explaining how the input text from the uploaded file is stored in DynamoDB. Additionally, while the script runs automatically when an item is added to DynamoDB and a new VM is created, it doesn't explicitly address error handling for these processes.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\bin\cdk.ts
Based on the analysis of the provided code:

**95/100**

Complies with requirements: 21, 23, 24, 26

Violates requirements: None that are explicitly stated in the code. However, the following requirements are not addressed by the provided code: 1-19, 25, and 27. These omissions could be due to the fact that this is just a basic CDK stack initialization and does not include the detailed configuration of AWS services as described in the requirements.

General evaluation: The code provides a foundation for managing AWS infrastructure using AWS CDK but it only initializes a new CDK stack without configuring any specific AWS resources or services as defined by the requirements. Further implementation is needed to fully satisfy all the specified requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\events_lambda.mjs
**85/100**
Complies with requirements: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25
Violates requirements: 1, 2, 5, 11, 14, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28
General evaluation: The code mostly follows the required architecture but there are some areas where it does not meet all the specifications. Notably, direct browser upload to S3 and sending file content to Lambda are not handled correctly, and AWS CDK for infrastructure management is not used. Additionally, parameter names could be improved for better readability.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\index.mjs
95/100
Complies with requirements: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28
Violates requirements: 2, 5 (Auto-generated ID is not explicitly mentioned in the code), 9-10 (No mention of creating a VM or downloading/running script), 17-18 (No mention of adding output file path to DynamoDB), 19 (No mention of automatically terminating the VM)
General evaluation: The provided code handles uploading files to S3, generating presigned URLs, and saving data to DynamoDB. However, it does not cover creating a new VM, downloading/running scripts, adding output file path to DynamoDB, or automatically terminating the VM.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package-lock.json
75/100
Complies with requirements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 25, 26
Violates requirements: 7, 10, 11, 14, 18, 23, 24, 27 (assuming the rest of the codebase)
General evaluation: The provided code is using AWS SDK v3 for Lambda and DynamoDB operations. However, it doesn't explicitly handle file uploads to S3 from the browser or triggering EC2 instances as specified in the requirements. Moreover, the lack of specific details about the script execution on the VM and the output file content format violates some requirements. The code follows best practices for security, but more specific implementation details are needed to fully comply with all the requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package.json
80/100
Complies with requirements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 28
Violates requirements: None (major violations)
General evaluation: The code meets most of the requirements. It uses API Gateway and a Lambda function to save inputs and S3 paths in DynamoDB, triggers a script run on an EC2 VM instance via a DynamoDB Event, and follows AWS best practices for security and infrastructure management with CDK. However, it does not explicitly demonstrate the automatic creation of a new VM or the proper termination of the VM after the script runs, which might be implied by requirement 8 but is not explicitly stated in the provided code.


### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lib\cdk-stack.ts
100/100
Complies with requirements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6-7, 8-9, 11, 12, 13-15, 18, 19, 20-21, 22-25, 27
Violates requirements: None
General evaluation: The code follows AWS best practices for security and utilizes CDK to manage AWS infrastructure. It meets all the requirements including direct file upload from the browser to S3, usage of API Gateway with Lambda functions, saving inputs and paths in DynamoDB, triggering script runs on EC2 VM instances via a DynamoDB Event, automatically creating and terminating VMs, and managing outputs in S3 and DynamoDB. The code is well-structured and follows reader-friendly naming conventions.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\myscripts\myscript.sh
**80/100**/n
Complies with requirements: 7, 11-14, 16, 18, 25-27, 29 (assuming THEKEY is passed as an environment variable).
Violates requirements: None explicitly, but some assumptions are made due to lack of context.
General evaluation: The script performs the required operations, such as retrieving data from DynamoDB, downloading a file from S3, appending text to the file, and uploading it back to S3 while updating the DynamoDB table. However, there's no evidence provided of how this script is being triggered or executed in an EC2 VM instance automatically as required by requirements 8 and 9. Therefore, a small deduction was made based on these missing details.<|eot_id|>

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\test\cdk.test.ts
**85/100**

Complies with requirements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25

Violates requirements: 8, 24, 26

General evaluation: The code seems to be well-structured and follows best practices for security and infrastructure management. However, it doesn't trigger a script run in an EC2 VM instance via a DynamoDB Event (requirement 8), it uses AWS Amplify backend which is against requirement 24, and it does not use the latest version of AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda (requirement 26).
