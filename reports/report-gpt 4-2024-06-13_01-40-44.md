## Detailed Analysis

### ..\aws-challenge\README.md
Based on the code file and descriptions provided, I cannot see any direct code but according to descriptions and file organization mentioned, I have the following findings:

1. **CDK Infrastructure Deployment**: The provided instructions show deployment of infrastructure via CDK. However, the script to actual create and define these resources (S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, EC2 instance, Lambda functions) isn't provided.

2. **Lambda Functions**: According to the folder structure two Lambda functions exist, but there's no detail about SDK version used and how files are uploaded to S3 and parameters are sent to DynamoDB, which are key requirements.

3. **File Upload Procedure**: According to your requirements, the input file should be uploaded directly from the browser to S3. But from the description, it's unclear if the process fulfills this requirement. 

4. **Accessing DynamoDB**: The script should retrieve input data from DynamoDB with an ID. It's unclear if the provided system does this via EC2 instance. 

5. **Running the Script**: It's unclear if the provided system can execute the required script on an EC2 instance, which should get input data, download a file from S3, amend the file with the input data, and upload it back to S3. 

6. **VM Creation/Termination**: Your requirements dictate an EC2 instance should be created and terminated each time a file is uploaded. It's unclear if the provided system does this. 

7. **ReactJS Frontend**: As per the requirement, the entire system should be created using AWS CDK and AWS SDK for JavaScript v3. But it appears that part of the system, the frontend, is created with ReactJS.

8. **AWS Best Practices**: It's unclear if the author followed AWS best practices, like not storing credentials in the code or environment variables, as the actual code isn't provided.

To properly analyze this code, please provide code files for Lambda function implementations, CDK infrastructure creation, and details about how the EC2 instance is created or managed. It would also be great if there's some form of visual monitor or log of system progress to verify requirements fulfilment.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\.npmignore
You have provided some project requirements, system components, and some ignored file patterns of a gitignore file but you haven't provided any code to analyze. 

Kindly provide the code which should be analyzed based on the requirements and the system components you have mentioned. 

For the given use case, you will need the following AWS Services:
- Frontend: React application running on an Amazon S3 bucket and using the AWS SDK for JavaScript to upload a file to an S3 bucket.
- Messaging: MinIO or Amazon SNS to notify the backend when a new file upload is completed.
- Backend: AWS Lambda function using the AWS SDK for JavaScript V3 to process the notification and perform necessary operations with DynamoDB and EC2.
- Storage: An Amazon S3 bucket to store the uploaded files. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to make sure that the bucket is not publicly accessible.
- Database: Amazon DynamoDB to store metadata about the file and processing status.
- Compute: Amazon EC2 instances to execute scripts, you might want to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use AWS CDK to define and provision the AWS cloud application resources. 

Please provide the actual code, so that I can provide a comprehensive review.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\cdk.json
The provided snippet seems to be a part of the CDK configuration file. However, without the complete source code, analyzing the provided code for each requirement in full depth is not possible. Nevertheless, I can provide some general remarks regarding AWS infrastructure services and practices as well as recommendations based on the supplied code.

1. Managing AWS Infrastructure using AWS CDK (TypeScript): The code configuration appears to set parameters for a TypeScript application using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). Although without seeing the actual infrastructure definitions (not present), it's impossible to determine if they meet the requirements of the task.

2. Usage of AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda: We unfortunately have no evidence in the provided snippet to demonstrate if AWS SDK V3 is being used in an AWS Lambda function. That would be shown in the code within individual Lambda functions.

3. No AWS access key / credentials in code: From the provided context, no AWS access keys or credentials are exposed which reflects a secure practice. However, the actual AWS infrastructure definition files, functions code, and scripts are not provided.

4. No SSH and No hard-coded parameters: The provided code snippet does not suggest any usage of SSH or hard-coded parameters, which is a good sign. However, the actual function code, scripts and full CDK scripts are required for a thorough examination.

5. Reader-friendly variable names: The provided JSON document consists of AWS CDK context flags. These flags have standard, recognizable names, and couldn't be altered by a developer. So it is not applicable to discuss readability here. For other variable names readability, source code is needed.

6. Privacy of txt file in S3 & DynamoDB actions: The is no defitintive information in the code snippet that assures whether the txt file uploaded to S3 is not public. Moreover, There's also no specific code sample provided that interacts with DynamoDB or triggers EC2 VM instantiation.

7. No AWS Amplify backend: Based on the supplied code, we can confirm that Amplify isn't referenced. However, the entire codebase is needed for full validation.

8. AWS best practices: The code snippet isn't violating AWS best practices as no AWS credentials are present, and it's seemingly using the latest CDK context. However, full compliance can't be ascertained without looking at the full codebase.

9. EC2 VM instantiation: The script's requirement to initiate a new VM within EC2 when a new item is added

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\jest.config.js
The provided code doesn't meet any of the listed requirements specified in the request. This is just a Jest configuration file for a TypeScript project.

The configuration is setting the testing environment to be Node.js, specifies the directory where the tests will be searched for (`<rootDir>/test`), ensures that the tests end with `.test.ts`, and ensures TypeScript files are transformed using `ts-jest` before the tests are run.

However, the requirements are not addressed by this configuration file at all. They detail a series of complex AWS resource interactions involving file uploads, Amazon S3 bucket management, Amazon DynamoDB interaction, an AWS Lambda function, an Amazon EC2 instance provision and script execution, but there is no such code present.

In short, the provided code snippet is not relevant to the listed system requirements. You will need to create an AWS CDK application that involves AWS S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services as per your requirements.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\package.json
The provided document appears to be a part of a package.json file for a Node.js project. Here's an analysis of the given requirements vs. the provided code:

1. AWS CDK is properly set up as specified in the requirement. `"aws-cdk": "2.136.0"` and `"aws-cdk-lib": "^2.136.0"` shows that AWS CDK is added to the project and the latest version is being used.

2. Use AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda: In this analysis, there is no code that verifies or denies usage of AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda, as the SDK is not listed in the package.json file's dependencies.

3. Proper handling of AWS Access keys: The requirement is met, as we don't see any hard-coded keys in the provided code.

4. No SSH usage and hard-coded parameters: The requirement is met, as the current provided portion doesn't contain any SSH-related functionality or any hard-coded parameters.

5. User-friendly variable names: Based on the provided portion, this requirement is met since the script and command names are quite plain and self-explanatory.

6. Private S3 file: Can't validate as no code available to analyze this requirement.

7. Avoiding AWS Amplify backend: Can't validate as no code available to analyze this requirement.

8. AWS Best Practices: Based on the provided portion, we can say that current code is following best practices like avoiding hard-coded key values, and keeping all dependencies up-to-date.

9. DynamoDB Event result in new VM creation: Can't validate as no code available to analyze this requirement.

In summary, it is impossible to perform a holistic validation of all requirements against the provided code since it pertains only to package definitions. You should provide the code that interacts with S3, DynamoDB, and EC2 for a thorough analysis.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\tsconfig.json
This provided file appears to be a `tsconfig.json` file for a TypeScript project. It provides options to the TypeScript compiler to follow certain rules when compiling TypeScript to JavaScript.

This configuration specifies the following:

- The compiled JavaScript target is ES2020.
- Modules will use CommonJS module system.
- It includes DOM and ES2020 typings.
- TypeScript declarations (`.d.ts` files) are to be emitted.
- It enforces strict TypeScript rules like, require variables to be declared before being used, ensures non-void functions should return a value.
- It doesn't check unused local and parameter values.
- It uses inline source maps, and original source content is included within source map.
- Experimental decorators from TypeScript are enabled (as often used in Angular projects).
- Strict property initialization checks are disabled.
- Custom type roots are specified.
- Excludes to be not included in compilation are node_modules and the cdk.out directories.

However, this file doesn't seem to have any direct relation to the given system requirements. It's a part of the environmental setup for a TypeScript project using the AWS CDK.

I can't analyze this code based on the provided requirements because the code is not related to those. The requirements specify the design of a system involving various AWS services, while the provided `tsconfig.json` just gives TypeScript compile-time configurations.

For analyzing JavaScript/TypeScript AWS CDK, AWS SDK and Lambda function related implementation, please provide the relevant code files.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\bin\cdk.ts
The provided code snippet seems to be the initial boilerplate template created by running the AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) command `cdk init app --language typescript`. Your main application file in Typescript uses the AWS CDK to initialize an app and a stack. However, without the rest of the code - specifically the content of your `CdkStack` in `'../lib/cdk-stack'` - it's hard to do a detailed analysis or verify how well it fits your requirements.

Here's what needs to be done to meet your specified requirements:

1. **Upload File to S3 Bucket from the Browser**: This usually involves generating a presigned URL with a PUT action, which can be done using a Lambda function. The presigned URL can upload files to S3 directly bypassing server. 

2. **Save Input and S3 Path in DynamoDB**: After the file is uploaded to S3, send the file name and other parameters to your API Gateway endpoint. The Lambda function associated with the endpoint should process the request, format a record, and save it to DynamoDB using the V3 AWS SDK.

3. **Trigger Script in EC2 Instance through DynamoDB Event**: Once the record is saved in the DynamoDB table, it can trigger a Lambda function through DynamoDB Streams. This function should be responsible for creating EC2 instances, executing your scripts, and terminating the instances when completed.

4. **Use AWS CDK for Infrastructure**: As per the sample snippet, you followed this as you set your app's environment.

5. **AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambdas**: While this isn't shown in the snippet, it's a recommendation you should follow.

6. **No AWS Access Keys in Code**: As a best practice, you need to use IAM roles for your EC2 instances and Lambdas.

7. **No SSH, No Hard-Coded Parameters, and Reader-friendly names**: Guidelines that should be followed during the development process.

8. **S3 Files are not Public**: Make sure to configure your S3 bucket's policy so that files are not public.

9. **Avoid AWS Amplify backend and Follow AWS Best Practices**: Helpful guidelines.

10. **Error Handling**: Make sure every Lambda function includes adequate error handling.

Remember, for a more thorough analysis, providing the rest of your code would be necessary.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\events_lambda.mjs
This is an AWS Lambda function written in Node.js to automatically spawn a new EC2 instance by responding to an insert event in DynamoDB table and run a script on the EC2 instance to process some files. Based on file operation scenario and without knowing what the myscript.sh file's content is, below are some code analytics:

1. Lambda Triggered by Event: This lambda function has been designed to get triggered on receipt of an event.

2. Import Client: The EC2Client is imported from the '@aws-sdk/client-ec2' package to interact with EC2.

3. Event Processing: It receives an event and processes it to identify if it is an "INSERT" event.

4. IAM Role: An IAM role for the EC2 instance is provided via an environment variable INSTANCE_PROFILE_ARN.

5. User Data Script: The "newCommands" variable holds a script which downloads and executes a script file named 'myscript.sh' from a fixed S3 bucket and stores the output in a 'log.txt' file. The UserData field of the EC2 instance is set with these commands. 

6. EC2 Instance Configuration: If the event is an insert event, a new EC2 instance is initiated with a predefined image id, instance type, security group, and other configurations. The instance is set to terminate after the execution of the user data script.

7. EC2 Instance Creation: The EC2 instance is then created using the 'RunInstancesCommand' API.

8. Error Handling: The function includes error handling, and it will log the error to the console in case of failure.

The code does seem to follow many of the listed requirements: It seems to be using the AWS SDK (likely V3 based on the coding style), it does not hard-code any AWS access keys within the script, and it does not appear to be using AWS Amplify. However, there are certain listed requirements are not directly addressed in this code or require additional checks:

- File upload to S3: Based on the above setup, file upload to S3 isn't directly observed in this code. 
- DynamoDB insert: The triggering point, i.e. inset into DynamoDB is mentioned but cannot be observed in the code.
- No hard-coded parameters, the AMI id 'ami-0900fe555666598a2' is hard-coded.
- The code does not demonstrate that it's using the latest AWS CDK and AWS SDK JavaScript V3

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\index.mjs
The given code is a Lambda function written in Node.js. It uses AWS SDK for JavaScript V3 to handle S3 and DynamoDB operations and 'nanoid' to generate unique ids. However, the code does not align fully with the given requirements.

Here's a brief analysis:

1. Uploading the file to S3: The function generates a pre-signed URL which can be used to upload a file directly from a client to the S3 bucket using a PUT request. This satisfies the related requirement.

2. Saving the inputs and S3 path in DynamoDB: The code saves the 'inputText' data and the S3 file path to a DynamoDB table, 'fovus-presigned-url-upload-table-a'. This is after checking that the pre-signed URL was created by checking statusCode from response.

3. Triggering an EC2 instance and running scripts: No part of the function deals with managing EC2 instances or triggering scripts inside them. These tasks are not being accomplished.

4. Security: The function does not hardcode any AWS credentials or make use of SSH, as stated in the requirements. The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' is set to 'http://localhost:3000' which is an acceptable practice for development, but should be changed in production.

5. Additional Requirements: The function does not use AWS Amplify, and it does follow some AWS Best Practices, such as not embedding AWS credentials directly in the code.

Keep in mind that for the full requirements, you still need to build the mechanism for triggering the EC2 instances and script running post this Lambda execution. This might require modifications to DynamoDB stream, Lambda for EC2 creation and instance profile permissions for S3 and DynamoDB interactions done inside the script. Lastly, the error handling part in EC2 scripts is also not covered in these requirements and need to be handled separately.

For maintainability, it would also be good to externalize the bucket names, region information, DynamoDB table names, etc., as environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager as opposed to hard coding.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package-lock.json
The provided code block seems to be a generated lockfile for a Node.js project that specifies exact versions of dependencies to be installed. It indicates that the `nanoid` package is being used, which is known for generating unique string IDs that may be used for various purposes. However, nothing else about the architecture or deployment is specified in this file.

As such, considering the requirements, it is not possible to determine from this file alone whether they have been met. 

Here is what we can assert:

- "nanoid" package is used, so the file is prepared to auto-generate id for DynamoDB FileTable rows.
- There are no AWS access keys / credentials in this lockfile which fits the requirement from security aspect.

But it's necessary to have more context or code in order to comprehensively analyze and ascertain whether the file meets the mentioned requirements. Most of the requirements pertain to elements like S3, DynamoDB, EC2, and Lambda functions which are not mentioned in this lockfile. 

The lockfile only provides the information about the dependencies your project has with the exact version number to be installed.

Please provide a more appropriate code for analysis, such as functions configuring S3, DynamoDb, EC2 and Lambda handlers.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lambda\package.json
Based on the information given, there are several points that I can't validate:

1. No AWS CDK usage: Since the code is not present, it's impossible to analyze whether AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) is used or not. However, the `dependencies` section does not have the `aws-cdk` library.
   
2. AWS SDK v3 usage: Again, without the code, it's hard to tell whether the AWS SDK is used and whether it's in version 3 or not. And the required `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb` dependencies are missing.

3. Security: There is no code to analyze if there's AWS access key/credentials in the code. 
   
4. No hard-coded parameters: There's no code to review, so it's difficult to determine if there are any parameters or variables, and whether they are reader-friendly.
   
5. S3 txt file visibility: Without the code or clear AWS infrastructure setup instruction, there's no way to verify this condition.
   
6. No AWS Amplify backend: Impossible to confirm without the actual code.
   
7. Following AWS Best Practices: Without any details, it's hard to confirm whether the best practices are followed or violated. 

8. New VM creation and trigger: There aren't any code snippets or cloudformation templates to check this.

The only point from given requirements that can be validated is usage of "nanoid" library as it is listed in the code's dependencies. More code is needed to fully analyze the requirements according to the given scenarios.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\lib\cdk-stack.ts
The provided TypeScript file is using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to deploy infrastructure for a system that uploads text files to S3, logs these inputs and the S3 path into a DynamoDB table, and triggers a script to run on an EC2 instance when an upload occurs. The script creates a new VM, downloads the uploaded file, appends some text, and saves a new file to S3. 

Main features of the code:

1. It defines an S3 bucket and sets it to automatically remove objects upon removal of the Stack with versioning enabled. It also sets CORS rules for the bucket.

2. It deploys a lambda function from the 'lambda' directory of the project with a policy allowing 'PutObject' action on the S3 bucket.

3. It creates an API Gateway HTTP API with the lambda function as an integration.

4. It creates a DynamoDB table with an enabled stream for new records and gives full access on this table to the lambda function.

5. It defines IAM roles and policies for EC2 instances with the permissions needed to interact with S3 and DynamoDB.

6. It deploys another lambda function triggered by the DynamoDB stream events which appears to create and control the EC2 instances.

7. IAM roles and policies are set to allow the creation and control of EC2 instances by the second Lambda function.

Missing features and potential issues:

1. It doesn't appear to generate pre-signed URLs for browser-to-S3 uploads.

2. It's assuming that scripts are located in 'myscripts' and lambdas in 'lambda', but these directories are not guaranteed to exist.

3. It uses wildcard permissions (s3:*) for S3 and DynamoDB which might not be a best practice due to security risks associated.

4. Error handling mechanisms are not present in the setup which is a missing requirement.

5. The Lambda functions' internals aren't visible here, where the business logic should be residing.

Overall, this script seems to fulfill many of the outlined requirements but does miss on some critical aspects which would need to be addressed.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\myscripts\myscript.sh
Based on the requirements given, the code seems to be a part of the solution that gets the inputs from the DynamoDB table and downloads the file from an S3 bucket. It appends the input text to the input file, uploads the output to the same S3 bucket, and updates the DynamoDB table with the new output file path. It does a lot of what your system wants, but not everything.

However, there are some notable issues:
1. This script is written in Bash and not TypeScript or JavaScript as specifically requested in your requirements (Amazon CDK's preferred languages).
2. The script lacks any error handling. If any command fails, the script will continue to run until its end.
3. The AWS access key/credentials aren't in the code as requested, however, they are implicitly used by the AWS CLI. You need to be wary about where this script runs and how it gets the AWS credentials.
4. This script does not meet your requirement of using AWS SDK JavaScript V3 for Lambda. It uses AWS CLI instead.
5. This script does not satisfy the requirement of working with a newly created EC2 instance. It seems to assume that the EC2 instance already exists.
6. It appears to have a hardcoded-ish table name 'fovus-presigned-url-upload-table-a'. It's not a hard parameter, but would make the script fail on tables with other names. This does not meet your requirement of no hard-coded parameters.
7. We cannot identify whether the script to manage AWS Infrastructure using AWS CDK exists just from this file.
8. Requirements enforce not to expose the text file in S3 publicly, which isn't confirmed in this script. It requires S3 bucket-level settings to ensure it.
   
To improve this script, it would be better to re-write it in TypeScript and use AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3). It also needs error handling wherever it's possible to encounter an error, especially when interacting with AWS services due to their potentially fluctuating nature. The architecture should be managed using AWS CDK as required.

### ..\aws-challenge\cdk\test\cdk.test.ts
The provided code snippet is an automated test in JavaScript to verify whether an AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue has been created with a 'VisibilityTimeout' of 300 via Cloud Development Kit (CDK) AWS. However, the specific code will test the condition only when uncommented.

This test does not directly address the requirements outlined. Following the requirements, the missing components or snippets of code that should be looked for are:

1. The AWS S3 path and bucket name, and the file being uploaded to AWS S3 directly from the browser.
2. A DynamoDB table, specifically named 'FileTable', where the input text and S3 path are to be stored.
3. An API Gateway and Lambda function to facilitate the storage of inputs in the DynamoDB table.
4. Use of the nanoid library to generate id.
5. The creation of a new VM instance using EC2 after the new input file is uploaded to S3 and added to DynamoDB.
6. The triggering of script run based on DynamoDB events.
7. Code to download the script from S3 to the VM.
8. Code to retrieve inputs from the DynamoDB table by id.
9. A DynamoDB trigger to start the script on EC2.
10. Mechanism to download the input file from S3 onto the VM.
11. Append the retrieved input text to the downloaded input file.
12. The upload of the output file back to S3.
13. Store the outputs and S3 path in the DynamoDB FileTable.
14. Terminate the VM automatically after the process is complete.

Since these pieces are missing in the code provided, it's not possible to validate if the critical requirements have been met just from this snippet. Furthermore, it would be worth mentioning the use of AWS SDK JavaScript V3 is not evident in the provided code. Also, there's no explicit use of AWS CDK, AWS access keys or credentials, SSH, hard-coded parameters, AWS Amplify backend. It is also not possible to evaluate how error handling has been implemented.
